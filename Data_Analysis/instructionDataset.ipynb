      "This disclosure describes methods for contact tracing using information from devices for near-field communications (NFC), combined with auxiliary information from other (non-NFC) sensors such as inertial motion sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) and magnetometers. Methods using low-frequency NFC in the low MHz range of frequencies have the advantage of being robust in the presence of interfering objects, unlike other means of communication and proximity tracking using much higher frequency electromagnetic signals such as Bluetooth, GPS, and laser positioning. The method relies on unique features of NFC using inductively coupled devices to solve an optimization problem yielding the closest distance of approach of two NFC devices and can be adapted to handle multiple pairs of devices simultaneously. Location data is only required and generated in a local coordinate system (independent of absolute locations) which helps to preserve privacy. An individual device that determines the presence of another device within a prescribed distance (e.g., 2 meters or 6 feet) stores a unique identifier of the other device along with a timestamp in its memory in encrypted form and separately uploads this same information securely to a central database. The methods disclosed can also be used for other applications such as gaming where keeping track of contacts between participants in a local coordinate system, while maintaining privacy, is useful.\n",
