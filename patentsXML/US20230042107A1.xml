<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An electric vehicle or a hybrid vehicle is a vehicle that obtains power by driving a motor mainly using a battery as a power supply. The electric vehicles are being actively researched because they are alternatives that can solve pollution and energy problems of internal combustion vehicles. Rechargeable batteries are used in various external apparatuses other than the electric vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, as a battery having a high output and a large charging capacity is required, a battery pack in which a plurality of battery modules are connected in series is used. Since each battery module includes a plurality of battery cells, it is required to measure a voltage of the battery cell in order to diagnose the battery.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An integrated circuit (IC)-type cell voltage sensing circuit is used to measure the voltage of the battery cell. Currently, a separate cell voltage sensing IC is connected to each battery module. For example, one or more cell voltage sensing ICs are connected to one battery module, and one or more separate cell voltage sensing ICs are connected to another battery module. Accordingly, as the number of battery modules included in the battery pack increases, the number of required cell voltage sensing ICs increases, and thus the cost of the battery may increase.</p>

The electric vehicles are being actively researched because they are alternatives that can solve pollution and energy problems of internal combustion vehicles. Rechargeable batteries are used in various external apparatuses other than the electric vehicles.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

Currently, a separate cell voltage sensing IC is connected to each battery module. For example, one or more cell voltage sensing ICs are connected to one battery module, and one or more separate cell voltage sensing ICs are connected to another battery module. Accordingly, as the number of battery modules included in the battery pack increases, the number of required cell voltage sensing ICs increases, and thus the cost of the battery may increase.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>
