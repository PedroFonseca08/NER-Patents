<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In accordance with embodiments described herein interactive, electronic networks, in the form of computer-implemented, enterprise applications or platforms according to the present disclosure will be described in detail. The embodiments herein are presented in a systems level description. Specific examples of code have been written, and other specific code could be written by persons of ordinary skill in this field of technology and that would enable operation of the inventions described herein. Techniques and commercially available applications for generation of such specific computer-implemented code are well-known and the capability to write such code is well within the level of skill of ordinary coders who work in this field of technology.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">In its most general sense, the present invention is a computer-implemented enterprise application or platform configured to provide functionality as further described. Embodiments of the application or platform are preferably intended to work in conjunction with the systems and processes described in International application PCT/US13/062504, U.S. application Ser. No. 14/040,677, filed 28 Sep. 2013, now U.S. Pat. No. 9,338,622 issued May 10, 2016, U.S. provisional application 61/882,593, filed 25 Sep. 2013, U.S. provisional application 61/709,710, filed 4 Oct. 2012, U.S. provisional application 62/324,283, filed 18 Apr. 2016, and U.S. provisional application 62/379,150, filed 24 Aug. 2016, (the subject matter of which is individually and collectively referred to as contextually intelligent communication platform(s) or CICP(s)), and each of which is incorporated herein by reference. The presently described embodiments do not depend or rely on the CICP(s), but preferably include one or more aspects, components and/or features of the CICP(s) incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The presently described embodiments are directed to CICPs that have a master control component, which preferably is an enterprise holding a master license for that specific enterprise, and having the capability to assign sub-levels of control and various types of access to that enterprise-specific application.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Also, the master licensee is preferably granted permission to sub-lease access to selected and defined sub-licensees. The present computer software implemented application can thereby be distributed in a manner that will permit specific enterprise licensees and sub-licensees to generate commerce by controlling and being responsible for all operations of the specific MTCICP application licensed to that enterprise and its licensees and sub-licensees, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The multiple layers of control and multiple types of access and control within and spanning the multiple layers are advantageous aspects of the present application, and enable the capability of sending the correct or right messages to the correct or right user(s) at the correct or right time and place.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Multi-Tenant, Real-Time Embodiments Adapted for Delivery of Contextually Intelligent Content, Offers and Experiences to Designated Recipients</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-118</figref> preferred embodiments of the interactive, computer software implemented electronic network application may be configured as a multi-tenant contextual intelligent communication platform (MTCICP) that functions to deliver real-time contextually relevant content, offers and experiences to designated recipients while simultaneously gathering and recording real-time performance data for multiple administrators or users associated with multiple organizations that are connected to the application and having access to various designated levels and designated types of access within, among and spanning the levels and types of access for each organization or group of multiple organizations.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, the Master Control <b>200</b> may be configured to grant access to designated users for various designated levels, sub-levels, controls, sub-controls, parts and/or components of the application or system based on any of numerous predesignated criteria. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for example, at Master Control <b>200</b>, the application is preferably implemented for a specific enterprise, such as for example a national chain retail store, a hospital, a convention center, etc. Master Control <b>200</b> preferably is computer-implemented software or code that has the capability of controlling all of the types, sub-types, levels and sub-levels of control and/or access for users within the enterprise and for users outside of the enterprise who have been granted some degree of access to a specific enterprise application. Preferably the Master Control <b>200</b> will be operated by a master licensee who licenses rights to use the enterprise application for its specific enterprise and who preferably has rights to sub-license rights under a master license. For convenience a person performing the functions of, or operating the Master Control will be referred to as the master control user. This user preferably has the ability to control access to and operations of lower or sub-levels of control as shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> architecture and to control users at the lower or sub-levels. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, illustrative sub-levels of control are shown at sub-level 1 control <b>202</b>, sub-level <b>2</b>A control <b>204</b>, sub-level 2B control <b>206</b> and sub-level 2C control <b>208</b>. The users of the sub-levels are referred herein to as sub-level control users. The Master Control <b>200</b> is shown as having one sub-level <b>202</b>. Sub-level 1 control <b>202</b> is shown as having three sub-levels 2A, 2B and 2C at <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> and <b>208</b>, respectively. Sub-level 2A control <b>204</b> is shown as having three sub-levels 3A, 3B and 3C at <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> and <b>214</b>, respectively. Sub-level 3C control <b>214</b> is shown as having three sub-levels 4A, 4B and 4C at <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> and <b>220</b>, respectively. At sub-level control 4B, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> then continues, by showing in generalized form the capability of the application to create and function with N additional sub-level controls. The number N can be a large number, depending primarily on the complexity of the specific enterprise and the number of users. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, N=4 and thus the sub-level N+1A control <b>222</b>, N+1B control <b>224</b>, N+1C control <b>226</b> and N+1D control <b>228</b> would each be at the fifth sub-level, respectively, and so on with the system capable of having additional controls and users at each sub-level (control E, control F, control G, etc.) and additional sub-levels beyond five sub-levels (sub-level 6, sub-level 7, sub-level 8, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Preferably the system enables the master control user with authority and capability to control the specific enterprise MTCICP, including all sub-level controls. The system is preferably adapted to enable the master control user/licensee to sub-lease or grant access to predesignated and defined licensees and/or sub-control users.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The enterprise application is preferably distributed or provided to users by conventional means, such as to the master control user/licensee by an Internet connection. The master control user can then further distribute or provide specific levels of control within the specific MTCICP, also by conventional means, so that the licensed enterprise itself will operate the specific enterprise platform in a manner that will generate commerce or some other activity. Preferably, the master control user/licensee will be responsible for all operations of the specific MTCICP, such as, for example, sales and distribution for a manufacturing or retail business; patient care and communication for a health provider enterprise; access to and communication with governmental units for a governmental application; and providing education, instruction and training at virtually all levels and types of learning activities for an educational enterprise. The capability of the application or system to provide the master control user/licensee control with access to and use of each of, and groups of multiple layers, multiple controls at each sub-level and/or multiple types of control of the platform is an advantageous feature of the present system because it provides the capability of ensuring that the correct or right message(s) are sent to the correct or right person(s) or user(s) at the correct or right time and to/from the correct or right place(s).</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a general, exemplary architecture or scheme whereby the various levels of access are grouped into functional of areas of influence, such as sub-level 2 controls <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> designated as within area of influence A, shown at <b>230</b>. Sub-level 3 controls <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> are designated as within area of influence B, shown at <b>232</b>. Sub-level 4 controls <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> and <b>220</b> are designated as within area of influence C, shown at <b>234</b>. In the general case, sub-level N+1, controls <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> and <b>228</b> are designated as within area of influence N+1, shown at <b>236</b>. The exemplary system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a system that is an extension of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> system, and is a system in which the areas of influence are preferably controlled by respective sub-users who are positioned at the various layers or levels of the overall architecture, although defining and designating areas of influence may be tasks assigned to some other system user, such as for example, the master control user. In another aspect of the nature of the areas of influence or definition or designation of areas of influence, an area of influence can be designated or defined, for example, as a geographical area, a subset of clients that designated sub-control users have access to, some grouping of users for which access is time-limited, or for which access is granted on some other predefined criterion or criteria. Thus, the system is adapted to provide for one or more areas of influence that can be defined by multiple criteria, such as a geographical area and specification of characteristics of a user or groups of users, interests of a user or group(s) of users, specific position of the user(s) in the larger geographical area, identity of any device(s) to which the end user has access, any device(s) associated with the end user and so forth. With respect to the system embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, controls of and for the various levels and controls of and within each level and sub-level are shown. Preferably, specific assignment or designation of a specific degree or type of control and/or access is based on the nature of an area's influence at each of the various layers of system administration, respectively. Preferably, the master control and/or master control user has the capability to assign to one or more of the sub-levels of control, and the capability to set further controls at each level and sub-level. As one example, consider a convention center, such as the San Diego Convention Center, to be the master control and having a master control user. The Convention Center could lease designated Convention Center assets, and lease control of the system's sub-level 1 to a sub-level 1 control user, who could be a convention manager for a specific convention at the Convention Center or the convention sponsor of a specific convention at the Convention Center. The sub-level 1 user would then have access to the leased facilities and leased system during a specific time, such as when that specific convention is open in San Diego. The sub-level 1 control user would then have, for example, access to certain or predesignated sections of the Convention Center during certain or predesignated periods. More specifically, consider the well-known Comic-Con convention in which the convention manager or organization that hosts the convention then leases or sub-leases space in the convention center to exhibitors and content owners during that time. The number and types of levels and controls is variable, and can be changed over time. For example, in the case of Comic-Con, the entire Convention Center might be leased for control by the sponsor. For other conventions, perhaps taking place at the same or overlapping times, such as the American Cancer Society convention and the American Heart Association convention, only part of the Convention Center and part of the Convention Center assets would be leased to each organization, and each organization would have sub-level 1, “geo-control” over only the part of the Convention Center that it leased.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Continuing with the Comic-Con example, one exhibitor might be Marvel, who would lease space in the Convention Center from the convention organizer, i.e., the sub-level 1 user rather than from the master control user, which would be the Convention Center itself. Marvel might want the capability of having a proximity event trigger within its booth, and of having rights to influence only people within a certain distance from its booth. Also, exhibitor Marvel might want to have access to beacons or systems that are outside of the convention center, but included in the offerings by the Convention Center that are available to exhibitors. The system has the capability to provide for this level and type of access, and it could also be included in the lease. The ability or capability for the system to physically locate an end user inside or outside of the convention center is also included within the presently described system though use of various wireless devices. The system includes and uses a combination of proximity sensors, proximity beacons (or “i beacons”), near field communication tags (“NFC”) and augmented reality triggers, for example, images that are located only within the booth. As used in the present system, proximity beacons, such as “iBeacons™” brand proximity beacons are conventional devices that are relatively small and transmit low power, BlueTooth signals for a specific range. Each preferably has an identifier that is assigned to it and is controlled by one more users of the present system for a specific use or specific application such as the San Diego Convention Center Comic-Con convention. The conventional proximity beacon signaling is received by a sensor, and the signals are then transmitted through the various levels of control in the present system, in accordance with access and control assigned to the device and the users as described herein. When an authorized end user is within the predetermined proximity of the device, the device's signal is transmitted to and received by the end user. Such proximity beacons are available from several sources, such as Kontak.io, Gimbal and Estimote. Gimbal brand proximity beacons are preferred, specifically its Series S10, Series S20 and U-Series 5, although any conventional proximity beacon device may be used, so long as it performs its signaling functions as required by the system described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Considering another example, for use in a large retail enterprise, area of influence A could correspond to three countries in which the enterprise operates, area of influence B could correspond to three states in one of the three countries, area of influence C could correspond to three cities or counties or metropolitan regions within one of the states. Within area of influence C, a specific retail store could further designate areas of influence according to products, services or profit centers, such as “toys”, “women's clothing”, “sporting goods”, “restaurant”, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates granting different levels or degrees of control based on difference types of input, shown at <b>238</b>, <b>240</b>, <b>242</b> and <b>244</b>, respectively. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, another way in which the level and or degree of control could be assigned to users of the application is shown. Here the control is based on types of output, shown at <b>246</b>, <b>248</b>, <b>250</b> and <b>252</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, another way in which the level and/or degree of control could be assigned to users of the application is based on the type of access, as shown at <b>254</b>, <b>256</b>, <b>258</b> and <b>260</b>. Here the control is based on types of access to be granted to the various levels.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref> illustrate types of ways in which access and functionality for users can be assigned and controlled, but are intended not to limit the capabilities of the application. In general, virtually any defined feature and/or defined set of features, defined function and/or defined set of functions, defined location and/or set of defined locations, defined proximity and/or defined set of proximities may be used as criteria for the level of control and access that can be assigned or granted to specific users or groups of users of the application. Additional illustrative examples are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an exemplary listing of types of information that the system is adapted to receive as input into MTCICP <b>262</b> for a designated end user A, shown at <b>264</b>. The context input listing for end user A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> can correspond, in general to the context input described in the related applications identified above, and shown, for example in a list shown at <b>266</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref> of International application PCT/US13/062504. The inputs <b>266</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> (not individually numbered) include but are not limited to application-specific designations of who, what, where, when, device(s), activity(ies), profile(s), who else, what else, preference(s), reward(s), display method and sensor(s).</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">In an alternate embodiment MTCICP <b>268</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the application is adapted to accommodate multiple users 1+N, shown at <b>270</b> (end user A) and <b>272</b> (end user A+N) for content input as shown at arrow <b>274</b>. The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> embodiment MTCICP <b>268</b> also accommodates multiple users, and multiple context inputs, shown at arrows <b>270</b>, <b>272</b>, <b>274</b> and <b>276</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, alternate embodiment MTCICP <b>268</b> includes an exemplary listing <b>278</b> of types of information that the system is adapted to output from the MTCICP <b>268</b>, shown with arrow <b>276</b> to an end user A, shown at <b>280</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, alternate embodiment MTCICP <b>282</b> illustrates an adaptation in which the system is adapted to include any of numerous users, such as user A, shown at <b>284</b>, and users A+N, shown at <b>286</b>, where N is a positive integer, respectively. The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> MTCICP <b>282</b> is also adapted to include multiple context outputs, 1+N. where N is a positive integer, shown at <b>288</b> and arrow <b>290</b>. The context outputs illustrative list <b>292</b> may be adapted so that a different list is applied to each end user, or may be a single list applied to all of the users, or may be grouped such that specific groups of users may use the same list, with different lists for different groups of users.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Also, in other alternate embodiments, access to the application can be defined and granted for specific periods, such as at all times, or time(s) limited to one or more defined periods. Access may also be defined and granted on the basis of pre-determined conditions of performance, actions and/or activities, and/or during a defined period, a defined repeated period or for a defined variable period assigned by defined pre-determined performance or other criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Alternatively, access to the application also can be defined and granted, for example, on the basis of a fee, a defined participation of revenues generated, a defined monthly fee, a defined fee per active or non-active user(s) who have been granted or permitted access and who have actively opted into the system, against other defined compensation criteria or, for example, at no fee and for no other compensation.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Alternatively, access to the application can be limited to certain aspects of the MTCICP application, such as limited to certain defined or predesignated sensors, defined set(s) of sensors, defined proximity beacon(s) or one or more set(s) of defined proximity beacons, defined video displays or one or more sets of video displays, or other defined or predetermined connected devices such as kiosks, in-store displays, virtual reality display units that are connected to the system, and any combination of criteria corresponding to devices that are connected to the system.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Alternatively, access to the application can also be granted on the basis of defined, specific end users, defined set(s) of user groups and or defined set(s) of network-connected devices, such as a customer's mobile phone(s), wearable(s), AR glasses, body sensors or other devices connected to the system. The system is adapted to enable access to be controlled through requiring end users to grant permission to have such access via active opt-in functionality as may be part of the master licensee's privacy policies.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">The master licensee can also enable its authorized users to have access to, for example, related regulatory, and/or compliance organizations, expert organizations and/or commercial partners, subsidiaries, participants in a franchise structure, local, state and/or federal/national governments and governmental units, tourism organizations, health organizations, disease control organizations, law enforcement and/or other parties in accordance with privacy policies and applicable law corresponding to a particular enterprise, users, groups of users, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Users who have been granted access to an enterprise-specific application can then use the authorized aspects of the MTCICP. For example, depending on the level and type of access granted, the user can control specific devices, can use specific features and functions of the specific MTCICP to deliver content, enable experiences, deliver messages, encourage behavior, reward behavior, monitor behavior, record behavior, encourage commerce, complete sales, reward for sales, make recommendations, encourage healthy behavior, stop and/or prevent unsafe or dangerous behavior, verify delivery of content and offers, verify actions taken, reward to encourage repeat behavior of desired behavior and discourage unwanted, unsafe or inappropriate behavior, and engage in educational activities, such as specific on-line educational courses or training.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">As these above actions are taken, each specific MTCICP application preferably records all interactions corresponding to that application.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">The various levels and types of access to the application can also be assigned, granted, and/or extended to entities and users that are remote from the initial geographical area of the installation. For example, they can be located in geographical areas beyond the location of the master licensee or the location of the master control of the MTCICP application. In regard to a convention center as an enterprise having a MTCICP installation, master license and master control over its specific enterprise installation, the convention master control could grant limited and specific access to extended entities or users such as restaurants, bars, hotels, shops, local retailers, tour operators, travel agents, taxi drivers and other entities and users interested in communicating with attendees of the convention center, but that are not physically located at that convention center.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an illustrative listing of types of content that can be input into the MTCICP <b>262</b> from or by a single end user A with one or more connected devices is shown. These types of inputs can include the types of input and from the types of input devices that are described and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-13</figref> of International application PCT/US13/062504. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic drawing that provides a listing of the same types of context input as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, but from multiple users, each of which is referred to as end user A+N, where N is an integer, shown at <b>272</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an illustrative listing <b>278</b> of types of content that can be output from the MTCICP <b>268</b> as shown with arrow <b>276</b> to a single end user A, <b>280</b> is shown. These types of output can include the types of output and from the types of input devices that are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref> of International application PCT/US13/062504. Again referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an exemplary listing of the same types of context output as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is provided, but with the MTCICP <b>282</b> adapted for use with multiple users, each of which is referred to as end user A+N, shown at <b>286</b> and where N is a positive integer.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an alternate embodiment system <b>294</b> infrastructure is shown. The infrastructure <b>294</b> includes MTCICP <b>296</b> and different types and levels of responsibilities, control and input. In this instance, a management team <b>298</b> is shown, listing, for example (not individually numbered) executives, other management users, IT services and users, maintenance functions and users, consultants and other employees. The management team <b>298</b> users preferably are the users who control the system and define the information that goes into the MTCICP system <b>296</b> as shown by arrow <b>298</b>A. Management Team <b>298</b> illustrates what would be some examples of different types of users that could be defined as included in a management team for a specific application, generally in terms of the functions that each type of user or groups of users would perform in comparison to the functions of other types of users, such as workforce users and users whose products or services could be useful to the other users. In another application, for instance, in an airport use example, if an executive is walking the facilities and sees a problem with one of the flight information displays (“FID”s) that digitally display flight information at gates or other locations at the airport, that executive could send an alert that there is a problem in FID No. <b>5</b>, for example, and the system will recognize where that location is, will recognize that the input is from an authorized member of the management team and is a request for service, will recognize who sent the alert and will determine the level or type of user who should receive this message. In this example the message preferably would not go to the janitorial staff; but rather, it would go to the IT staff, who would then investigate and address the problem identified by the executive.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Again referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, each of the executive group users <b>298</b> would be identified and assigned specific levels of authority, control and communication capabilities. For example, a CEO preferably will have the maximum or ultimate control or ability to send messages to any of the users, but a janitorial staff supervisor could have a relatively limited ability regarding the types of messages that could be sent and where the messages could be sent. For example, a janitorial or maintenance supervisor in the management team <b>298</b> would be blocked from sending messages that would change information on any of the FIDs for airlines using the airport. With respect to a convention center example, the various types of users in the executive group would have control, access and functionality from the organizational and operational standpoint of the facility. A designated supervisor could have overall control across the janitorial services and security services as well as the IT aspects of those parts of the system. With a system having multiple layers of supervisors, each supervisor preferably would have an area of influence that corresponds to that supervisor's actual responsibility. For example, the janitorial supervisor in charge of a specific section, such as “Section B” of a convention center, could have and use the same input mechanism, as described in the above example to identify an issue or a problem that that need to be addressed or that some other action needs to take place in Section B of the convention center. At the same time, while an upper management user, for example, the CEO, who may be touring the facilities and sees that there is another issue or problem, or the same issue or problem, and can send the same message or command as sent by the janitorial supervisor. However, the message or command from the CEO could go global to all users in the system, in comparison to the message or command send by the Section B janitorial supervisor, which message or command preferably would be sent only to the Section B janitorial staff.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">In general, each of the individual users in the management team <b>298</b> would have specific criteria that would identify to whom each would be able to send messages to. The system architecture enables the access level of each user to be preassigned and predefined, so that during operation of the system, the system automatically routes commands or other messages from specific users to specific users or groups of users. With this functionality each access level relates not only to access that the system would enable for an individual user, but also access that the individual user would have in order to send or initiate messages to other users or groups of users in the system or platform <b>294</b>, such as the MTCICP <b>296</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Additionally, specific enterprise applications of the system can be adapted so that access to a user from other users in the system can be different than access from any specific user, as indicated at arrow <b>300</b> and types of users <b>302</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Again referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, arrow <b>300</b>, the arrowhead points towards a group of service providers <b>302</b>. The arrow indicates that specific messages initiated by a management team <b>298</b> user would be sent to the MTCICP <b>296</b> for processing and then directed to a workforce team <b>302</b> user. Exemplary workforce users (not separately numbered) are listed as workforce, contractors, services, maintenance, consultants and employees in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Other, non-management team and non-workforce users are shown with arrow <b>304</b>, with the single arrowhead indicating the direction of transmission for certain types of messages. In the FIG. <b>10</b> example, the exemplary list of other users (not separately numbered) includes licensees, tenants, partners, parking, transport or transportation, such as taxis, and airlines.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Again with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, consider for example, a convention center as the enterprise, and a tenant user in a section, e.g. section <b>15</b>, where the tenant sells, among other products, coffee. Suppose there is a coffee spill at that location and the spill is noticed by a convention center management team user, specifically a maintenance supervisor of that section in the convention center. That supervisor's alert of the coffee spill is transmitted into the system at arrow <b>298</b>A, and the system <b>294</b> then as shown by arrow <b>300</b> alerts the maintenance staff and the service staff of the workforce <b>302</b> that is in control of that specific location. The system <b>294</b> also identifies the location of the spill, knows the location of each of the section's janitorial staff within the convention center and then automatically routes the message to the section staff user who is closest to the spill. Continuing with this example of a coffee spill, and the other users identified by arrow <b>304</b>, for example, the system <b>294</b> would send a message to the tenant who sells coffee in that section. That tenant would not be responsible for cleaning up the spill, but would want to know about it and be assured that the spill was being cleaned up by the convention center staff, and the message to the tenant would provide that information and assurance. In this example, the system alerts the tenant of that section that a facility manager has identified the spill and the cleaning staff has been assigned to clean up the coffee spill.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-12</figref>, the coffee spill example described above in regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is described, but from the perspective of the messages originating from and being received by affected users as the spill is being cleaned up (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) and after it has been cleaned up (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the spill is being cleaned up by a maintenance person as shown at arrow <b>306</b> by a message from the user who is cleaning the spill with the arrowhead pointing to the MTCICP <b>296</b>, which message is transmitted to the tenant, shown with arrow <b>308</b> pointing to the tenant, and to the originating reporting executive, shown at arrow <b>310</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, after the spill has been cleaned up the tenant has verified the clean-up as shown with arrow <b>312</b> pointing to the MTCICP <b>296</b>. A feedback report from the system <b>296</b> to the original supervisor is transmitted as shown by arrow <b>314</b> pointing to the original supervisor. In summary, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref> report the history of an incident, from discovery to reporting completion of corrective action.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, an event history <b>316</b> is shown. The event history preferably includes information on the actions taken, generates a record of the actions taken, and retains that information. An illustrative architecture or schematic flowchart is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, where an event occurs at <b>318</b>, and that event is input into the system <b>294</b> at arrow <b>320</b>. The system <b>294</b> then provides the input, shown at arrow <b>322</b> for a calculation or determination <b>324</b> based on this event, for example, simply that the event is recorded and no action is taken, or that some action is to be taken as shown at arrow <b>326</b>. The calculation can be based on a pre-programmed algorithm and that can be complex or can be simply a yes/no decision, as will be understood by those skilled in this field. The action, if any, shown at <b>328</b>, is then transmitted or delivered at arrow <b>330</b> to the affected user(s) at <b>332</b>, or in the case of no action taken, shown at <b>334</b> there would be no transmission, shown at <b>336</b>. In the case of no action, the “no action” event <b>334</b> is recorded and retained by the system at <b>336</b> and <b>338</b>. When an action has been taken at <b>328</b>, the result is delivered and recorded as shown at <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>340</b>, <b>342</b>, <b>344</b>, <b>346</b> and <b>358</b>. If no further action results from the delivery, then a “no action” is recorded and retained as shown at <b>348</b>, <b>350</b>, <b>352</b> and <b>354</b>. In either case of “no action” or when an “action” has been taken, the record is retained in the system, as shown at <b>356</b>, and <b>360</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Specific algorithms used in specific applications will be different according to and depending on the specific use of the platform or application of the system, such as shown at <b>294</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, and creation of specific code for each such specific application is within the skill of those of ordinary skill in this field. For example algorithms in a system for use in a sporting venue such as a stadium would be different from algorithms in a system for use in a convention center, or in a system for use in a national, retail chain. Writing such specific use code or algorithms is within the skill of those skilled in this field and all are considered to be within the scope of the presently described inventions. For example, algorithms for use in a sports oriented system where the events would be based on sensors on the body of one or more players during sports action would be different than algorithms for a marketing platform where an advertisement is presented on behalf of a beverage manufacturer and/or a specific restaurant, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, an alternate embodiment including a sensor network infrastructure <b>362</b> includes a series of sensors <b>364</b>, <b>366</b>, <b>368</b>, <b>370</b> and <b>372</b> identified as Senor A, Sensor B, Sensor C, Sensor D and Sensor +N, respectively. The network <b>362</b> also includes Sensor Hubs <b>374</b>, <b>376</b>, <b>378</b>, <b>380</b> and <b>382</b> that are connected together and in communication with or connected to the system as shown. Sensor A communicates with Sensor Hub Contextual Intelligent Communication Platform (“SHCICP”) <b>384</b> as shown at arrow <b>386</b>. As an example of a sensor, in this instance, a sensor can be a simple accelerometer that could be tied to the shoe and has blue tooth communication to another sensor that may detect the person's moisture, or sense how much that person is sweating. Those two sensors are adapted to communicate with a sensor hub, which in this instance a sensor hub can be the program that resides on, for example, a Samsung Gear S2 brand watch. The watch would be adapted to include a component of the CICP that combines the sensory input from each of these two sensors before it transmits the information to the MTCICP <b>296</b>. Sensor B at <b>366</b> also communicates to SHCICP <b>384</b>, as shown at arrow <b>386</b>A. Similarly, Sensor C at <b>368</b> communicates with Sensor Hub <b>374</b> as shown at arrow <b>388</b>, and Sensor Hub <b>374</b> communicates with SHCICP <b>390</b> as shown at arrow <b>392</b>. Sensor D at <b>370</b> communicates with Sensor Hub <b>376</b> as shown at arrow <b>394</b>, and Sensor Hub <b>376</b> communicates with SHCICP <b>396</b> as shown at arrow <b>398</b>. Sensor +N, at <b>372</b> also communicate with Sensor Hub <b>376</b> as shown at arrow <b>400</b>. Sensor Hub <b>378</b> and Sensor hub +N at <b>382</b> communicate with Sensor Hub <b>380</b> as shown at arrows <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>, and Sensor Hub <b>380</b> communicates with SHCICP <b>406</b> as shown at arrow <b>408</b>. SHCICPs <b>384</b>, <b>390</b>, <b>396</b> and <b>406</b> communicate with MTCICP <b>296</b> as shown at arrow <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</figref>, at <b>370</b>, <b>372</b>, <b>376</b>, <b>394</b>, <b>396</b>, <b>398</b> and <b>400</b>, information detected by one sensor could affect, in some way, the value that is output by another sensor. In other words, two or more sensors in communication with a single Sensor Hub and/or a single SHCICP need not be totally independent of each other, but rather the information output from one sensor could depend, in some way, on data that comes in from another sensor or other sensors. A Sensor Hub could be simply a hub that combines the data, and only collects and transmits data forward to a SHCICP. Sensor Hub CICPs, such as at <b>384</b>, <b>396</b> and <b>406</b> preferably have algorithms that function to combine data and to define an output that goes into MTCICP <b>296</b>. A specific system embodiment can be adapted to include sensor to sensor communication, sensor to sensor hub communication, and multiple sensors to a common sensor hub communication or multiple sensor hub communications to a common sensor hub in order to be transmitted through the system and into the platform. The sensor hub could be merely a pass-through, much like a switch, or, alternatively, it could also include some processing capability, but preferably the main processing capability will be in the SHCICP where the data is aggregated. The system can be adapted so that aggregation would be in a mobile device, in a series of mobile devices, in a field-based computer system, and/or in a call-by system, for example. As shown at arrow <b>410</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, output from the sensor hubs is transmitted to the MTCICP <b>296</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">As an example of how a <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> sensor-based embodiment could be adapted to operate or to be used, consider that the enterprise is a football team. In this example each player, during a training session at a training facility, is fitted with sensors on his shoes, ankles, wrists and/or in his helmet. Each sensor has a relatively low power transmitter and has the capability to define or generate data representative of the mobility of each body part, the rate of speed and the acceleration of each body part during play. These data are then combined or aggregated via an algorithm to create a full picture of the activity, that is, data representative of the motions and actions of the player. The sensors are preferably of low enough power, low enough transmission range and sufficiently lightweight to not adversely interfere with the activities of the player, but have enough power and transmission range to generate data useful for the intended purpose of the invention. For example, a hub could be a Samsung Gear brand watch or a watch-like device that is worn on the wrist or elsewhere on a user's body. The hub functions to collect the data from the sensors and to transmit the data to the server as described, for example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Continuing with the football player example, another sensor attached to the player could generate data that would correspond to or measure blood pressure or pulse rate of the player, in real time during play. Also, the sensor set could include a motion sensor, or a moisture monitor to determine the sweating level of the player. The hubs and SHCICPs could combine all these data to create a composite picture or data set for each player on the team and that would be representative of the player's condition. As another example, one or more accelerometers could be placed on a player's helmet and would be adapted to provide data representative of or directly proportional to the force of a hit during play, and that might provide other information, such as likelihood of a concussion resulting from the hit.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates use of the platform or system <b>412</b> for delivery of curated content <b>414</b>, for use in, for example a museum. The museum has an MTCICP system <b>416</b> in place, and has a content that is curated around specific exhibits. A person end user, who is a visitor to this museum, can experience that context as the user enters into the museum, and near the exhibit. The MTCICP system <b>412</b> can control delivery of the content by location of the user, by whom the content is delivered, what content is delivered to whom, how and when. The experiences that are being presented are curated in such a fashion that they have been prepared and approved by a control-user, such as a museum board of directors. The methodology of the delivery of the content can vary such as vary based on location. Delivery doesn't have to be only on the premises of the museum for instance. Now the content, the curated content <b>414</b>, can be delivered on the mobile device of the user(s) when they are at a specific location or area, for example, the ruins of Pompeii or at some other site of historical significance. Here curated content means that somebody of authority has created or approved information that is related to a specific area or topic. It is unlike an advertising campaign, which is about marketing and defining a sale, and it is unlike a sports event where input is from athletic performance.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the End User is shown at <b>428</b> coming into a context <b>420</b> that is defined by and recognized by the MTCICP <b>416</b> so that the curated content database <b>414</b> is accessed at <b>422</b>, <b>424</b>, and information relevant to that end user, based on the user's cross-referenced, personal information, is pulled from the curated content <b>414</b> at <b>426</b>, and that information in the right format is delivered to the End User <b>428</b> as shown at <b>430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates a system <b>432</b> adapted to enable context <b>420</b> relevant, curated experiences to occur using the present platform. In comparison to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> system, the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> system <b>432</b> includes a SHCICP <b>432</b> within the museum and that receives context <b>420</b> from the user <b>428</b>, shown by arrows <b>436</b> and <b>442</b>. The SHCICP <b>432</b> can be, for example an interactive display and can now identify the presence of the end user <b>428</b> as shown by arrow <b>434</b>, and provide information to and receive information from the MTCICP <b>416</b> as shown at arrows <b>438</b> and <b>440</b>, respectively. The curated content <b>414</b> could be a virtual reality experience such that when the user enters the environment, such as near a particular exhibit in the museum, a trigger is activated and the content is sent as shown with arrow <b>430</b> to the end user <b>428</b>. The content could be an immersion type experience, i.e., a 4D type environment where there is sound, video, wind and mist to create a virtual experience of what may have happened in the past. All triggered with curated content triggered by the SHCICP <b>432</b> that is embedded in that environment, controlled by an MTCICP <b>416</b> and via SHCICP <b>432</b> as shown at arrow <b>434</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates use of the platform as a curated content provider <b>444</b>, and in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref> additionally provides the capability of alerting a sales person staff member <b>446</b> of the presence of the visitor-end user <b>428</b> in an environment that has delivery of curated content via a sensor hub driven infrastructure SHCICP <b>432</b>. An alert of the visitor's presence is transmitted to the sales person staff so that that the sales person staff member <b>446</b> can enhance the experience for the visitor. Also, in a similar fashion but in a different end use—a retail business as the MTCICP <b>415</b> shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>—in which the end user is a shopper. In this case, the curated content would be information about an item for purchase, such as a laptop. The SHCICP <b>432</b> could be an interactive display of that computer where, when the customer comes in proximity to the computer augmented reality will be shown over the computer to identify the various features that are relevant to that specific computer. As these interactions are happening and the end user is consuming this curated contents about this laptop as shown by arrows <b>448</b>, <b>450</b> and <b>452</b>, sales person staff <b>446</b> is alerted about these interactions and is receiving from the MTCICP <b>415</b> information about the end user so that the salesperson can come to the end user with information to help close the sale, as shown with arrows <b>454</b>, <b>456</b> and <b>458</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates a curated shopping experience like that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, and including components of management oversights and capability to enhance the curated content based on a series of business intelligence data, such as shown at <b>460</b> , including a company-wide customer profile of all its customers, product data, business insight, trends, projections, inventory, sales tools, etc., that are useful to management <b>462</b> of a retail store. With use of this platform configuration the system will have information about the end user <b>428</b> to maximize the chances that a sale can be made to the user based on the historical information the system knows about the user. Also in order to make sure that the right product is sold, management needs to have control of what's in stock, the inventory levels, what's likely to sell out now and what would be appropriate incentives to sell designated products. Examples of business insight could include trends, such as the weakening dollar versus yen, and should a certain type of product be pushed on a specific day, status of future delivery of orders of merchandise, staffing requirements or staffing issues, forecasts of an upcoming snowstorm or a hurricane. In the present example, trends and projections are intended to be forward looking as where the business wants to go, rather than known information and predictions on what is actually going to happen and what is happening within specific areas. Sales tools could refer to, for example, information such as the best words in order to sell a particular product or special features of a product in comparison to a competitor's product.</p>

In this instance the patient has an issue which is detected by a device and transmits an alert <b>502</b> into a facility that has an MTCICP system <b>504</b> that tracks the device. In this instance, the issue is reported to all of the staff members that are on call at the health care facility, as shown at <b>504</b> A, B, C. The alert <b>504</b> comes to the physicians, other staff, and the nurses on call. In this example the issue raised by the patient is an issue for the physician <b>506</b> to handle.

This tablet <b>528</b> preferably also communicates directly with the wrist device <b>526</b> worn by the patient, as shown at arrow <b>536</b>, or can connect directly to the MTCICP <b>522</b> via other means such as 3G or WiFi, as shown with arrow <b>538</b>. The wrist device communicates with MTCICP <b>522</b>, as shown at arrow <b>540</b>. The MTCICP alerts the patient when it is time to take medication. The patient acknowledges receipt of the message and will say “yes, I'll take the medication”, thereby providing a medication compliance trigger back into the MTCICP, as shown at arrow <b>542</b>. Compliance can be displayed to the physician, the nurse, the administrator and the office administrator so that all are aware that the patient is complying with the regimens that they prescribed, as shown by arrows <b>544</b>, <b>546</b>, <b>548</b>, respectively. If the patient fails to acknowledge, an alarm can be sent to the discharge administrator <b>534</b>, who can then contact the patient directly. If the wearable <b>526</b> has detected an indication or fall, similarly an alarm can be sent to the discharge administrator <b>534</b> for action, such as calling an ambulance or contacting the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> illustrates a discharge system <b>550</b>, including discharge kit <b>518</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, and with the capability of providing curated content <b>552</b> to the patient. Here there is a need for the physician <b>506</b> to provide information <b>554</b> to the patient and with a need for a response <b>556</b>. In this example, medical information about a procedure is provided from the physician at <b>554</b> through the MTCICP. The information is delivered to the patient either via the wearable device or the patient discharge tablet at <b>558</b>. The response is at <b>560</b>, which is then put into the curated content <b>552</b> in case a complication has occurred. The system then can automatically identify whether there is a problem and if so communicates a message to all of the caregivers that are associated with the patient, namely the staff, the physician and the nurse, as shown at <b>556</b>, <b>566</b>, <b>566</b>, respectively. Any of them that has an input to provide based on the information from the curated content and the answer from the patient, at <b>560</b>, then delivers a response back into the system at <b>562</b>, <b>562</b>, <b>562</b>. A response from the responding caregiver is then sent via the MTCICP to the patient at <b>568</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is an exemplary flowchart of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> embodiment for it's capability to alert, and send the right message to the right person at the right time and place with an alarm/alert, or with no alarm/alert. In this example an alert <b>570</b> is delivered as shown at <b>572</b> to a patient who has been notified to take medication and the alert is confirmed at <b>574</b>. If the patient responded with a yes, at <b>576</b>, then the response is recorded and retained at <b>578</b>, <b>578</b>. If there is no response, at <b>580</b>, an alert can be sent at <b>582</b>, and if that alert is acknowledged at <b>584</b>, it can be recorded and retained at <b>586</b>, <b>588</b>. If there is no alert or no response to the alert, an alarm <b>590</b> can be sent and corrective action can be taken, recorded and retained at <b>592</b>, <b>594</b>, <b>596</b> and <b>598</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25, 25A and 25B</figref> illustrate a contextual intelligence system for extended caregivers. This is the same basic system as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> that provides for delivery of curated content to the patient, but includes two additional levels of influence for the patient. One level could be friend(s) or close family member(s) <b>600</b>, and the alert system can alert that person/those persons that there might be a problem as shown at <b>602</b>. As shown at <b>604</b>, that person is now alerted about the patient and asked to verify that everything is well. If that action has not happened or the family member cannot go to the patient, then the system could alert a user in a second group, such as a neighbor, volunteer, etc., as shown at <b>612</b>. Whoever acknowledges that they can respond, will get more detailed information, and then contact the patient at <b>614</b>. Regardless of who is contacted, the communications are recorded and reported into the system at <b>616</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">Another capability of the application, particularly advantageous when the enterprise is a convention center, or the like, is inclusion of facility sensors as input devices. In such instances, sensors in the facility can also communicate with the MTCICP and provide useful input data or information. The information can, for example range from audio, temperature, movement, noise, moisture, smoke or other conditions that the sensor(s) detect, record and/or transmit. The process of alert and alarm communication through the MTCICP will be routed to the correct MTCICP connected device. For example, a connected smoke alarm, when activated would cause the application to route the alarm to the Master Control and to the nearest fire station.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">As another example, connected sensors and the MTCICP could also be used to verify that a staff member has performed a given task. Such a task could be to open a refrigerated cooler or vending machine that is used to display and present cold drinks for sale or that dispenses cold drinks, respectively. The cooler or vending machine would have a proximity beacon. The enterprise specific application would provide information about the location of the cooler, by, for example a map showing the location of the device. As the staff member approaches the cooler, the proximity beacon will trigger an event on the staff member's device. This event is transmitted to the MTCICP server, recorded and retained as when the staff approached the cooler. The beacon inside will also transmit the temperature around it and its battery life. Both are transmitted to the connected device which then transmits this to the MTCICP. This is also recorded and retained by the MTCICP. Once the cooler door is opened, the temperature will drop. This is observed by the beacon sensor and transmitted to the staff member's connected device that then sends this to the MTCICP. This event is recorded and retained. The process is repeated when the staff member closes the door, and moves away from the cooler. Each event is recorded and retained by the MTCICP. Access can be granted to the MTCICP to the staff member's boss, his supervisor and the owner of the organization that services the coolers. The owner of the facility where the cooler or vending machine is placed can also be granted access to the MTCICP to review the collected and recorded data. The producer of the drinks that are sold or dispensed can also be granted access to the MTCICP to review the collected and recorded data. The same MTCICP has thereby been used to direct staff member to perform an action, verified that it has been performed, verified that the staff members was at the location, recorded when the staff member arrived, recorded how long he was there, and recorded when he left. The same system then can grant the ability to verify these events by the staff member's boss, the owner of the cooler and the owner of the location—all different entities and organizations.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">The MTCICP can also be used to control the actual functions and functionality of the building. It can be connected to Smart Building infrastructures and sensors, equipment, control systems and infrastructure. This can include switches, controls and sensors, door locks, access cards, elevators, escalators, fire suppression, HVAC, AC, heating, lights, power supplies, window shades and other aspects of the building controls. These sensors can be connected directly to the MTCICP or via sensor hubs that can communicate the aggregated results from a series of such sensors. Those sensors that can control functions will have 2-way communications so that they can receive commands and actions from the MTCICP based on the actions it determines, and that are based on the events for which it collects data. These events can be collected from a sensor or from a series of sensors in the facility, or from people or equipment that is in the building temporarily. The people will have mobile devices that have installed software or operating systems that are also connected to the MTCICP. They can have full access to the MTCICP system or have been granted access, for example, to only a select series of interactions, sensors or events, for a predetermined time or for always as long as their log in credentials are accredited. In this way the MTCICP system's multi-tenant architecture is used as a partition system that functions to grant access and deliver content to the right person at the right time, even within a building, venue or structure for those who work there, operate it, maintain it, provide safety and or services to the building and to those who work there, visit, stay or live there.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">The system will detect interactions with and between sensors and the people there as well as equipment that is mobile, record and retain these interactions. Those events that warrant an action will trigger actions to be transmitted to the right sensor or control unit or display or device or equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">This will enable the MTCICP to detect, e.g., how many people are in specific areas, determine the temperature in the area through devices such as NEST or Samsung Smart Works sensors, account for how many people are on the escalator coming to that room, start cooling the area via the control units on the NEST thermostat's control unit before the people enter because it is more efficient to cool the room than after they have arrived Likewise, light controls can be connected to turn on while there are people there, and off when they leave, creating “following lights” down corridors for instance. Elevators, moving sidewalks and escalators may also be connected in this manner providing low power speeds or remain stationary while there are no people close by or on the devices. The levels of controls can be set and controlled by the MTCICP. For instance, digital displays along the moving walkways can be programmed to present content and offers to the people on the moving walkway as they pass by.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">This methodology can work in spaces of any size, from across an apartment to across a 1-story building, to a large multi-story convention center or airport even across entire cities, islands or any geographical area.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">The MTCICP will retain real-time contextual data about how people interacts with facilities, areas indoors and outdoors, across all the physical geographical areas that have been defined by the MTCICP operators and administrators. These data will provide a deep level of records for the way a person interacts with his or her surroundings—real life physical interactions. These data are contextually anchored, by time, person, ID, the type of interactions, the location, the type of location, what content was presented, what content was consumed, what content was interacted upon, what products, equipment, sensors, displays, cars, sports equipment, buildings were interacted with, used, consumed, viewed. All data can be made anonymous should this be required by rules and regulation. All data can be retained and/or removed. All data can be used again. This way the system is looking at past behavior to determine what is likely to be of interest for a person “next” based on their past behavior and current context. This context match does not need to be based on the users past behavior. It can be leveraging what others in the same context, with the same or similar background profiles have found of interest. By blending all these components, the MTCICP will create its intelligence. The content that is being presented does not need to be sent back to the originating device. Such an example can be a sports fan that is a fan of the Ole Miss Football team. He has downloaded the Rebel rewards app which is connected to a MTCICP operated by the Ole Miss Athletics Department. He is at the game when a record is set and one of the team members is a guaranteed shoe-in for the Heisman trophy. The system recognizes that he was in the stands the moment this happened. Two weeks later, he is on-line at home on his tablet. A sports fan site has signed a deal with Ole Miss to produce baseball caps commemorating the event, and also signed a deal to access the MTCICP. The off-line experience of being at the stadium that moment triggered an event in the MTCICP that is recorded and retained. When he is back on-line the access is recognized and an action is sent. This action is to present a personalized offer to get the baseball cap personalized and shipped to his home address—all information is pre-programmed and included in the offer—so it's an on-click order to have a personalized baseball cap shipped and paid for—memorizing his time in the stand. Once he is back in the stadium, the system will recognize he is back, and offer him, e.g., a special Coke, Hot-dog and Fries for $5 since he was there at the magic moment and had purchased the hat. Coke had also access to the MTCICP and the past actions with the current context caused the offer that was made on-line to be extended off-line into the real world. The MTCICP can also be used in situations when the access to the platform is widely granted due to a specific event. Such can be a natural disaster such as an avalanche at a ski resort. The resort operator would have a MTCICP enabled system where beacons or devices are used by the skiers as a guidance and access tool. Proximity solutions can grant access to lifts; provide VIP access to restaurants and record number of runs the skier has skied down. In platform tracking can be used to record number of runs, vertical drop skied, speed and g-forces. In the event an avalanche occurs the system can be reversed and access to detect proximity between users—the skiers—can be granted to all. Should someone be buried in snow, that skier's device will continue to transmit “I am here” signals. In this instance, instead of fixed sensors in the facilities, every other skier with the system can receive an alert about the proximity of another skier. Should a skier be buried in snow, the skiers above will be alerted to those other skiers above and visible by eye-sight, will also be alerted to the proximity of those skiers who are out of sight—i.e., buried in the snow. Signal strength can be used to guide rescuers to the person buried as weakening signal indicates moving away, stronger means getting closer. While this is not 100% accurate, it will minimize the time needed to start digging and getting oxygen to those under snow. In this instance, the multi-tenant architecture has been used to turn a crowd into the authorized user of the system, enabling rescue efforts to be crowd-sourced before official and professional help arrives.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">Other uses of the multi-tenant feature of the MTCICP can be used in targeted advertising and programmatic delivery of advertisements, offers, coupons, content and experiences. Real time interactions with products, locations, sensors, printed materials and other contextual experiences will be gathered by the MTCICP as often as the system is programmed to gather the information. As this data is collected, it is combined with the information about the user that the user has given permission to collect. This data is gathered into a profile for the user. This profile can remain assigned to that specific person, or can be made anonymous and related to a specific user device and/or other way to anonymously identify that profile with past and future behavior as described herein. The MTCICP can be used by a third party who has been granted access to this system to present offers, content and experiences when that person at a later time interacts with this party's MTCICP or other communication systems. This system can be a re-targeting ad server, and artificial intelligent recommendation engine or other communication platform. The content delivered, and the action the user has taken upon the delivery of said content can then be used to further improve and expand the profile retained within the first MTCICP system.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">The content delivered via a MTCICP can also be generated, provided and/or curated by the operator owner of the MTCICP or authorized third party providers. One such embodiment is in a museum setting. The operator of the museum can install a MTCICP system. They can then assign personnel internally to curate content relevant to the artifacts they show. They can enable content and content descriptions relevant to their artifacts to be provided by 3rd parties and or common databases. The MTCICP will enable the right curated content to be delivered to the right person on the right device. Such devices can be the museum visitor's own devices that have MTCICP enabled applications installed, with the devices including those such as mobile phones and wearables, or devices that are lent or leased by the museum and remain their property, those that are leased by the MTCICP provider to the museum or devices that are fixed at the museum. These devices can also be tablets, phones, wearables, digital displays, AR devices, VR devices, connected rooms, and other future display systems such as HoloLens, Samsung GearVR or other VR display technologies. The curated content can be delivered by the museum operator via the MTCICP on-site inside the museum, outside on the museum property or off-site such as remote sites or historic sites, or cities or ruins beyond the physical boundaries of the museum. Should there be an entity that owns this location or has other interests in such a location, they can be granted access to control the curated experiences that are triggered on such a site via the administrated access to the designated feature set of the MTCICP.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">In a similar fashion, the owner of a sporting and/or education facility can grant access to the same MTCICP to multiple entities. The objective of this can be to enhance the experiences to those that are there, it can be to provide information, it can be to provide services, and it can be to provide safety and security. The same infrastructure of the MTCICP will enable all to access the same infrastructure, but to provide content and experiences that are within their domain or expertise or mandate. In such instances it can be used to promote a brand to a sports fan, while providing crowd control and security oversight to campus police, while granting access to concessionaires that want to sell products to the fans while in stadium. The same system can be used to provide educational content to students while in class rooms, enable automatic rollcall for attendance to university administrators while enabling educators in the room to push educational content at one time that is delivered personalized to the individual student in the designated room—or any other designated location. This system can also be used by students and teachers as a tool to learn how to deliver content, test what works and what does not, what inspired and drives activity and changes behavior, and what does not. In such an embodiment, the end users that experience these interactions can be limited to those who have granted the MTCICP permission to present such test cases, not the general public who have been granted permission only to final and commercial content.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">The MTCICP can be used to detect crowds and alert those users who are connected to the system about such crowds, and direct them to less crowded areas before entering or while in the crowded area. One such embodiment is the ability to display an indication of number of users at each entry gate at a sports facility that has an MTCICP system installed with end user devices that are connected. Based on the interactions the system has at each enabled location, and the dwell time each such interaction has, the MTCICP can detect the density of users and the time that they are expected to remain in this area. An approximation of wait time and density of people can thereby be deduced. The MTCICP can present this information on the end user's devices so that the end user can make a choice of which entry to use. In addition, the MTCICP can send messages to those people who are in a line at a crowded entry point and informed that there is a smaller crowds and/or a shorter anticipated wait time at another entry point. Likewise, the anticipated wait time can be displayed on interactive displays / signs that can provide those users that are there with an anticipated wait time. This can be extended and further enhanced in areas of long lines such as amusement parks or taxi lines at busy airports. Here numerous displays/signs with sensors can be placed with known and fixed distances between each. As a member with a MTCICP connected device comes into proximity to sign number 1, the MTCICP records the time. When he moves along and comes into proximity to sign/display number 2 that is a known distance apart from sign number 1, simple calculation can be made to determine the rate of speed. This process can be repeated along the line and once a slowdown is determined, the time for a person who enters the line at sign <b>1</b> to arrive at the final destination which is a distance known distance can be calculated by the MTCICP and displayed at the sign <b>1</b> and on the user's MTCICP connected device.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">Such understanding of location in a facility by the MTCICP and its permitted operators and users can also be used to facilitate roll-call, presence verification, and selected granted access, denial of access and/or check-in of a user with a device connected to the aforementioned MTCICP. Once such presence has been detected, the MTCICP can send alerts to others about the presence of the user in such an environment. This can be of great use to a hotel operator. As their guest arrives on the premises with a device that is connected to the hotel's MTCICP system, the MTCICP can send multiple messages alerting hotel staff about the guest's presence. This can be the car valet service and the bellboy services. They can be alerted by the MTCICP with details about the user such as name of the user, his status with the hotel rewards system to determine VIP level, his preferences and past visits thereby enabling the staff to present a personalized welcome. Should the hotel's MTCICP also be connected to the hotel's booking system, an automatic check-in can happen when sensors inside the lobby detect the presence of the user via his MTCICP connected devices. Should a payment be needed this payment can be tendered within the MTCICP if it has been so programmed. The payment tender can be closed via any of the current and future payment methodologies that have been incorporated into the MTCICP such as Samsung's PAY, Apple PAY, Google PAY, and Passport. Should the hotel MTCICP have been programmed to interact and be integrated with the hotel's room management and room key and room lock system, a token, message, programming code, other encrypted key granting access to the hotel room that the user has paid for can be delivered to the user's MTCICP connected device such as a mobile phone, wearable device such as a smart watch or other programmable device connected to the MTCICP. As the user arrives by his room, his connected device will grant him access via the MTCICP connected device to the room for the period that he has paid for via the MTCICP integrated room lock. As he enters the room with his MTCICP enabled device (s) his presence in the room is detected by sensors in the room. These can be passive sensors communicating with a room hub that communicates to the hotel MTCICP, control sensors that takes input and sends a control output command, and those that interact with both the user's MTCICP enabled devices and the hotel master MTCICP control systems. Interactions within the room can thereby controlled by input from the various sensors in the room with actions delivered to those devices they control, based on the presence of the user in the context as well as the use's past preferences as collected by the user's MTCICP connected device and / or a combination of this profile and the known past behavior and preferences of the user that the hotel MTCICP has retained and accessed and/or a third party's provided profile of the user that the hotel's MTCICP has been granted access to or any combination of any of the above. The room can therefore change its environment such as temperature, light, shades drawn or closed, radio station, tv channel based on the understanding of the user via the presence of his MTCICP enabled device in the environment that has sensors and controlled via the same connected MTCICP.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">The use of such a MTCICP multi-tenant platform enables numerous entities to use the MTCICP as a revenue generator for the operator owner licensee of the MTCICP. This can enable a faster return on investment as it can be capitalized as a revenue investment, marketing expense, subscription or lease investment rather than a capital expense investment.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">In larger geographical environments, such as regions, cities, islands and/or countries, multiple MTCICP platforms can be integrated across numerous vertical markets and numerous geographical areas with numerous end-users experiences under one master MTCICP.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">Such master MTCICP can be used by a city management to have real-time access to anonymous data and travel behavior across entire regions and cities. Such a system can provide the contextual intelligence for a smart city—numerous systems with various technologies providing real-time contextual data from private enterprises with governance data to provide better information and services to those who live there, enable those who work there to do so more effectively, entertain and service those who visit to encourage repeat visits while providing transportation, security, safety and services to all.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> depicts a floor plan <b>618</b> of a venue with hallways, individual rooms with separate entrances from the hallway, stairways and entry points such as a section of a hospital. In some of these rooms there are movable items such as patient beds <b>620</b>, <b>622</b>, <b>624</b> that are used to move patients across hospitals. These could be any moveable item.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> depicts the same floor plan as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, where bed <b>620</b> is in one room, bed <b>622</b> is in another room and bed <b>624</b> is shown in a 3<sup>rd </sup>room. Here a series of fixed proximity beacons and/or sensors are placed in the hallways and stairwell, and shown as sensors/proximity beacons <b>626</b>, <b>628</b>, <b>630</b>, <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>, <b>636</b>; beacon <b>638</b>; and stairwell sensor/proximity beacon <b>640</b>. Fixed beacons are used to identify a known location when somebody comes in proximity to that beacon. They are also useful in that having several beacons with overlapping signals permit triangulation based on those signals, so that the exact location of a person that is in connection with more than two, but ideally three, beacons at any given time can be determined. In this example beacons <b>620</b>A, <b>622</b>A and <b>624</b>A are attached to mobile pieces of equipment that can be moved, such as beds, EKG systems and so forth, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27</figref>, (attached to beds <b>620</b>, <b>622</b>, <b>624</b>, respectively).</p>

This location is known, as shown at arrow <b>678</b>. This can be a location, or series of locations that are pre-determined as “geo-locations”. The information about the Food and Drink and this or these locations are shared with SHCICP-MTCICP <b>680</b>. The SHCICP-MTCICP <b>686</b> can display this information on a mobile device, such as shown at <b>682</b>. This information can be, for example, to “Present Menu” on the device, “Enable Order” that enables a user to prepare and present an order based on the “Menu” presented on the device, “Send Order” that will enable the user to send the order presented, and the end user can chose to “Pick Up” the order or have it “Delivered to me” and finally enables the user to “Pay” for the order to complete the order. The mobile communication device <b>682</b> can be a mobile phone, mobile tablet or wearable the user is wearing, or it can be a fixed kiosk at the location or it can be a digital display in vicinity of one of the geo-locations. Once this information has been compiled on the Mobile Device <b>682</b>, the Mobile Device communicates this information to the SHCICP-MTCICP system <b>680</b>. This information is aggregated by the SHCICP-MTCICP system <b>680</b> to include location of the Mobile Device and any information about the end user that the user has approved for the SHCICP-MTCICP system to gather and retain, and sent to the appropriate Geolocation that produces and serves Food/Drinks shown at <b>681</b>.

These processes are then repeated as needed providing a real-time context aware, context intelligent CICP solutions that capture real-time data, do on cloud computations and edge computing to deliver content and experiences that “turns venues into destinations” <b>938</b>, “creates loyalty” <b>942</b>, “increases revenues” <b>944</b> and provides “conversions” <b>948</b> while recording, retaining and storing all relevant data, outcomes and actions in relevant databases. This approach ensures an intelligent and self-learning solution. This description in regard to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> embodiment is intended to be illustrative and not all encompassing.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> depicts the flow of “Big Data” and the use of this embodiment as an extension of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> and other uses of the invention to create “Intelligent Use of Big Data” <b>952</b> . Big data in this instance is depicted as data across a “smart city” installation of a SHCICP-MTCICP system <b>950</b>. The data collected from every smart phone, smart city sensor and Internet of Things (IoT) devices are collected and combined to deliver real-time behavior and patterns of behavior from both the physical world and the digital/mobile world shown at <b>954</b>. This is all combined to enable revenue enhancements. These data that have been collected are transmitted as shown with dashed arrow <b>956</b> to be displayed real-time on dashboards <b>958</b> so that the data can be reviewed and used for further calculations such as inference and recommendation algorithms, with the ability to see real-time results of campaigns, messages and commands sent. This real-time display of the data is shown as <b>958</b>. This ability to see immediate results on a dashboard or combinations of dashboards, is then used by others as shown with arrow <b>960</b>. The data can be used for evaluation shown at <b>962</b>. Such evaluations can be for evaluating campaigns and A-B testing that can for instance be used to convert browsers in a shopping mall to actual buyers, can provide information to people real time to manage crowds and can enable messages, content and experiences to be delivered to drive healthy behavior such as taking the stairs in a government office rather than the elevators. Instead of the typical reporting capability of traditional big data systems that provide reports in the future of what is happening now, or provide reports now of what happened in the past, this system enables real-time viewing of real-time events as they actually unfold, the results of messages sent and the results of campaigns and A-B testing. This real-time use of data can be a tool to provide content to influence behavior. This complete process leads to “intelligent use of Big Data” <b>952</b> as shown by arrow <b>964</b>. This is one of the core principles of the complete CICP, MTCICP, SHCICP and SHCICP-MTCICP group of systems. This <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> embodiment is intended to be illustrative and not all encompassing.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">Smart City Example</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44, 44A, 44B and 44C</figref> depict a complete SHCICP-MTCICP infrastructure for a Smart City that incorporates a convention center herein named “FIRA” <b>966</b> with complete solutions for the travelers and exhibitors that attend and exhibit at the convention. It starts providing information before the attendees arrive as indicated by “Planning the trip” <b>908</b>. The trip planning includes “transport” <b>970</b> to the exhibit city and venue, educate and understand the location city by obtaining maps and identify locations, planning any events there or close by or relevant to the event <b>974</b>, investigating weather forecasts <b>976</b>, seeing and investigating what events are on “Whats On” <b>978</b>, set up, integrate with calendars, populate Customer Relationship Management solutions, “CRM/KYC” <b>980</b>, network with others that are going to the event/convention <b>982</b>, gather, seek, execute on, and/or decline offers that are relevant to the convention <b>984</b> and finally shop before the event for needed products relevant to the event and the travel, <b>986</b>. These efforts are presented, enabled, enhanced, activated with content, connections, information, instructions, payments, booking, ordering, confirmations and other tools presented to the user planning the trip by the FIRA SHCICP-MTCICP <b>966</b> via bi-directional communication shown with arrow <b>988</b>. As the user travels to the event as shown with dashed line arrow <b>940</b>, the user arrives at an airport near the FIRA convention center location, shown as airport <b>992</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44B</figref>. For simplicity, the description will follow the flow of the end user and will therefore include a combination of structures, events and actions as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44A, 44B and 44C</figref>. Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44B</figref>, the user crosses a geofence <b>994</b> while arriving at the airport. The user will be presented with information <b>996</b> based on his exact location at the specific airport. This information can include a weather forecast <b>998</b> at the city he has arrived in, information about and trigger of VIP services <b>1000</b>, maps of the airport and surrounding areas including other nearby locations <b>1002</b>, as well as more immediate and relevant information based on the airport such as waiting times <b>1004</b> for taxis, public transportation, connections, security, customs etc. The user can also be served up recommendations for activities or other instructions, commonly referred to here as “action recommendations” <b>1006</b>. All the activity has the objective of providing information, content and data relevant to the experience and enable a transfer to the hotel “Getting to the City/Hotel” <b>1008</b>. All interactions, content, commands, instructions and offers are presented from the SHCICP-MTCICP <b>966</b> via the bi-directional communication shown as <b>1010</b>. All communication, content, instructions, offers and the results of the presentation of these are in communication via the SHCICP-MTCICP <b>966</b> via bi-directional communication, shown with arrow <b>1011</b>. Now we follow the user to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44A</figref>, “On Way to the hotel” activity designation <b>1012</b>. On the way there the user is learning “what's on/what's to do” <b>1014</b>, transportation options to events and elsewhere <b>1016</b>, local and future weather forecasts <b>1018</b> and gets the options to “provide and explore recommendations” <b>1020</b> similar to the rating/customer review solutions provided by many travel solutions such as Expedia, BookIt and others. All communication, content, instructions, offers and the results of the presentation of these are in communication with the SHCICP-MTCICP <b>966</b> via bi-directional communication, shown at arrow <b>1022</b>. We follow the user as he is now checking in at the hotel <b>1026</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44B</figref>. The hotel location is geofenced, shown at <b>1028</b> to identify the location and verify the arrival of the user there. Check-in procedures, features and functions <b>1030</b> are presented. Local maps <b>1032</b> are presented, wait times <b>1034</b> are displayed when available, with VIP services <b>1036</b> activated for appropriate users. Offers to upgrade <b>1038</b> are also presented to accredited users, with other offers such as cross sell bundle deals are presented and shown at <b>1040</b>. Offers to network with other event goers may be presented, as shown at <b>1042</b>, with wayfinding across the hotel enabled when available, shown at <b>1044</b>. All communication, content, instructions, offers and the results of the presentation of these are in communication via the SHCICP-MTCICP <b>966</b> via bi directional communication shown at <b>1046</b>. We are now following the user as he decides to go to the city to do some shopping before going to the venue, as shown with dashed line <b>1048</b>. We transfer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44C</figref> to follow the user into the city, shown at <b>1050</b>. Here, geofences, one of which is shown at <b>1052</b>, and proximity beacons and beacon networks, and other location sensors referred to as “proximity sensing”, and shown at <b>1054</b> identifies and maps his locations as he moves across the city. He can check in at participating locations that may offer rewards or other benefits for being there, as shown at <b>1056</b> and may receive offers, content and coupons based on this location as he enters the city and he moves around. Information on “what to do and what's on” can be presented, as shown at <b>1058</b>, with the ability to provide and explore recommendations, shown at <b>1060</b>. Information can also be presented in Augmented Reality, referred to as “AR Info”, and shown at <b>1062</b>. All communication, content, instructions, offers and the results of the presentation of these are in communication via the SHCICP-MTCICP <b>966</b> via bi-directional communication, shown with arrow <b>1064</b>. As the user moves across the city, goes into “shopping mode/shopping context”, referred to as “shopping” and which movement and mode change is shown by dashed line <b>1068</b>, and then is actively shopping, shown at <b>1070</b>, a similar process is repeated. As he moves around, then geofences <b>1072</b>, proximity beacons and beacon networks, and other location sensors, collectively referred to as “proximity sensing” <b>1074</b> identifies and maps his locations as he moves across the city shopping. He can check in at participating locations that may offer rewards or other benefits for being there, shown at <b>1076</b> and may receive offers, content and coupons based on this location as the user enters the city and he moves around, with one such item, a coupon shown at <b>1078</b>. Information on “VIP services” <b>1080</b> can be presented while shopping. Information can also be presented in Augmented Reality, “AR Info”, shown at<b>1082</b>. He can be offered more offers based on what he buys, shown as “Cross/Upsell” <b>1084</b>. All communication, content, instructions, offers and the results of the presentation of these are in bi-communication with the SHCICP-MTCICP <b>966</b>, as shown by arrow <b>1086</b>. After shopping, the user now goes to the venue <b>1090</b>, shown by arrow <b>1088</b> and arrives at the venue <b>1090</b>. There he is presented with a map, shown as Maps/Location <b>1092</b> that shows him the venue, with information where the shortest lines are, referred to as “waiting times” <b>1094</b>, so that he can check in quickly and efficiently, shown at <b>1096</b>. He is offered information such as a weather forecast <b>1098</b>, what's on/what to do shown at <b>1100</b> and presented with Action recommendations such as what events, exhibits, talks and demos to attend, <b>1102</b>. Information may be presented in AR, shown at <b>1104</b>. All communication, content, instructions, offers and the results of the presentation of these are in communication via the SHCICP-MTCICP <b>966</b> via bi-directional communication, shown with arrow <b>1106</b>. The user now starts walking across the “FIRA” convention center, as illustrated with dashed line <b>1108</b>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44B and 44C</figref>, and the user's context is now “interacting with exhibitors” <b>1110</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44B</figref>. At the FIRA center he is presented with wayfinding and a map of the center, <b>1112</b>. He is offered a file folder depository on his mobile device that gathers information as the user walks around, a “digital bag” <b>1114</b> to gather all the information from the exhibitors as he walks around, where he “receives targeted messages of interest” <b>1116</b> based on proximity sensing <b>1118</b> that verifies which booth he is in. Some of the offers and information are presented as AR experiences <b>1120</b>, some may include coupons and offers, shown as “couponing” <b>1122</b>, and some may provide options to provide feedback, <b>1124</b>. The user is presented with the option to rate the exhibitors and the products and solutions that are presented <b>1126</b> with some offering private areas, exclusive content and private demos and showings <b>1128</b>. As the user is about to end the day, the system presents Transport Options <b>1130</b> back to the hotel he is staying at, including the route which he travels on <b>1132</b>. All communication, content, instructions, offers and the results of the presentation of these are in communication via the SHCICP-MTCICP <b>966</b> via bi-directional communication shown with arrow <b>1134</b>. The user is back at the hotel <b>1026</b> and the process repeats while arriving there. Next day he returns to the exhibit venue <b>1090</b> as shown with dashed line <b>1136</b>. The process repeats there and then on to interacting with the exhibitors <b>1110</b>. At the final day he leaves hotel <b>1026</b> as shown in dashed line <b>1138</b>. During return travel as shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44A</figref> as <b>1140</b>, the platform can provide offers and coupons for the traveler, referred to as “couponing <b>1142</b> and based on the user crossing geo-fences, <b>1144</b>, together with the request to provide feedback, <b>1146</b>. The return travel can include departure from the arriving airport <b>992</b>. All communication, content, instructions, offers and the results of the presentation of these are in communication via the SHCICP-MTCICP <b>966</b> via bi-directional communication, illustrated with arrow <b>1146</b>. This system thereby incorporates transportation to the venue, namely “Airport” and from airport to the hotel “To the hotel” <b>1008</b>, enables hospitality to interact as indicated by “At the Hotel”<b>1026</b>. As the attendee travels to the exhibition, the system can interact as indicated by “To the Venue” <b>1090</b>. It also shows how the attendee and exhibitors can interact and create connections at the exhibit as indicated by ‘Interacting with exhibitors” <b>1110</b>. As the attendee is in the city before and after the event, the system can interact as indicated by “in the city” <b>1050</b>, and can be used to encourage retail shopping shown as “Shopping” <b>1070</b>. Each of the locations have a series of experiences that can be triggered and enabled, features that can be used, technologies that are integrated and content delivery. This is all part of the context intelligence gathering capability of a complete SHCICP-MTCICP infrastructure, as well as the contextually intelligent distribution of content and experiences by the same complete SHCICP-MTCICP infrastructure. This example is intended to be illustrative and not all encompassing.</p>

<p id="p-0347" num="0346">Distribution of CICP systems via Software Developer Kits (SDK)</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0347"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</figref> is a schematic overview of how CICP systems, for example SHCICP <b>3234</b>, CICP, <b>3236</b> and / or MTCICP <b>3238</b> can be distributed via a Software Developer Kit (SDK) to various levels of users, implementers, consultants and enterprises. The SHCICP, CICP and/or MTCICP are connected to the control databases such as—but not limited to—Customer Database <b>3240</b>, the enterprise's own Enterprise Database <b>3242</b> and a database or number of databases with information about the relevant experiences, actions, context, locations, merchandise and or event as shown as Experience Database <b>3244</b>. These databases communicate with the SHCICP, CICP and/or MTCICP as shown with links shown as <b>3246</b>. Each SHCICP, CICP and/or MTCICP solution has been programmed to be able to be distributed via a dedicated SDK <b>3248</b> as is a common and well established distribution model for software and platform solutions that are in communication with the SDK as indicated by links <b>3250</b>. One advantageous aspect of this embodiment of the invention is that the SDK will be programmed to have features and complexity based on the type of distributor depicted as “Developer” <b>3252</b>, “Enterprise IT” <b>3254</b> or “Small/Midsize Business” <b>3256</b> all of which are in communication with the SDK <b>3248</b> as shown by link <b>3258</b>. If the distributer is a “Developer” <b>3252</b>, there are two ways this “Developer” can distribute the solution to its “End User” <b>3260</b>: via a single “Business Customer “N” <b>3262</b> with a dedicated solution distributed as shown with arrow <b>3264</b> and presented to the End User <b>3260</b> as shown with arrow <b>3266</b>. If the Developer <b>3252</b> wants to build a common solution that can be distributed to many business owners, he can create one common solution using the SDK as shown with arrow <b>3268</b> for “Business Customer “N+1” <b>3270</b> who will share with numerous End Users <b>3260</b> as shown with arrow <b>3272</b>. An SDK can also be created for an Enterprise, shown as “Enterprise IT” at <b>3254</b>, which receives a solution as shown with arrows <b>3258</b> and <b>3254</b>. Should a specific Enterprise Unit <b>3274</b> be created by the Enterprise <b>3254</b>, the solution will be transmitted to End User(s) shown at <b>3278</b>, via arrows <b>3376</b> and <b>3280</b>, or from an Enterprise IT Department <b>3282</b> that can use the solution, and can create a specific solution for Enterprise Unit <b>3274</b> as shown with arrow <b>3286</b>. The same Enterprise IT <b>3254</b> Department <b>3282</b> can distribute solutions to other Enterprise Departments not separately shown, but like that shown at <b>3282</b> via links not shown, but like the link shown with arrow <b>3284</b>, and who can create their own versions to distribute to their Enterprise IT End Users, not shown but like the User shown at <b>3278</b> and via links not shown but like the link as shown with arrow <b>3286</b>. Should a Small/Midsize Business use the SDK, it is likely they do not have the resources to further develop sub-solutions and therefore more likely to create solutions directly for the communications with their End User <b>3288</b> and distribute this directly as shown via arrow <b>3290</b>. This embodiment is for illustrative purposes and not intended to be all encompassing.</p>

<p id="p-0352" num="0351"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 102</figref> is a schematic diagram overview of an embodiment of the invention in which multiple users are engaged in a variety of curated experiences, game play and / or other content experience in the systems described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 101</figref>. In this embodiment multiple users are experiencing the curated experience individually with each experience delivered and controlled via a central Contextually Intelligent Geolocation and Sensor Experience Replay Game Processor (CIGSERGP) <b>3354</b>. User A <b>3356</b> is experiencing the curated experience served by the CIGSERGP and transmitted to User A as shown with arrow <b>3358</b>. The feedback from the system as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 101</figref> is then transmitted back to the CIGSERGP as shown with arrow <b>3360</b>. Further enhanced curated content is then sent back to User A via a shown as arrow <b>3362</b>, and this process is repeated as long as the user is engaged with the curated experience in AR, VR and/or MR. User B <b>3364</b> is receiving curated experiences in a similar fashion, that is, curated, personalized and delivered to him based on his location, past user behavior and experiences as delivered by the CIGSEGP via a link shown as arrow <b>3366</b>. Feedback from the system as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 101</figref> is then transmitted to the CIGSERGP <b>3354</b> as shown with arrow <b>3368</b>. Further enhanced curated content is then sent back to User B via a link shown as arrow <b>3370</b>, and this process is repeated as long as the user is engaged with the curated experience in AR, VR and/or MR. Furthermore, feedback, input and or data collected from User B by the CIGSERGP via link <b>3368</b> can be used to further enhance the curated experiences delivered to User A via link <b>3362</b>. Conversely, input, feedback, results and other data gathered by the CIGSERGP regarding User A via link <b>3360</b> can be used to further enhance the curated content delivered in link <b>3370</b> to user B. Feedback loops <b>3358</b>, <b>3360</b>, <b>3362</b>, <b>3366</b>, <b>3368</b> and <b>3370</b> enable the CIGSERGP <b>3354</b> to continue to gather, record, retain and improve information about the curated experiences. This knowledge can then be transmitted by the CIGSERGP <b>3354</b> to the various databases and control systems for further enhancement of each component, as shown by the various links that connect the system components, initially starting with the link from the CIGSERCP <b>3354</b> as shown with arrow <b>3372</b>. This will provide feedback to the “Customer Database” <b>3374</b> as shown with arrow <b>3376</b>, “Location Database” <b>3378</b> as shown with arrow <b>3380</b> and “Experience Database” <b>3382</b> as shown by arrow <b>3384</b> which all record and retain relevant data for future real-time use, while presenting the relevant information to the relevant SHCICP <b>3386</b>, CICP <b>3388</b> and/or MTCICP <b>3390</b> system for further enhancement of content, experiences and/or control commands, while enhancing the “Game-Play Database” <b>3392</b> which is in bi-directional communication with all the various CICPs systems as shown with arrow <b>3394</b> and the Augmentation Database <b>3396</b> which is in bi-directional communication with all the various CICP systems as shown with <b>3398</b>.

The feedback from these systems is transmitted back to the End User's Device as shown by arrow <b>3484</b> in the same manner as shown with arrow <b>3474</b>. The aggregated data is then transmitted back to the End User's Database as shown with arrow <b>3486</b>. Data from these interactions are then communicated back to the device, as shown with arrow <b>3488</b> so the device is ready for the next context interaction with the knowledge from the past interactions with information generated when the End User was in Context A and in Context B. This information flow in the communication loop will then continue as the User moves from Context to Context with the End User's Database gathering, recording, retaining the data gathered, and presenting it back to the CICP, MTCICP and SHCICP systems in new contexts to further enhance the end user curated experiences.

<p id="p-0361" num="0360"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 109</figref> is a schematic overview of another embodiment of the invention where a CICP <b>3554</b> system is used to identify specific users in a context setting. In this instance, “End User A” <b>3556</b> has a condition as identified by the “Condition Database” <b>3558</b>, a database with known information about the user from “End User A Database” <b>3560</b>, a care team that is known, as shown as “Care Team Database” <b>3562</b> and is in a context with numerous other users, such as “End User A, End User B, End User C and End User N+<b>1</b>, collectively shown at <b>3564</b>. There is also a database used by an organization such as a police department or rescue team, shown as “Police/Rescue Team Database <b>3566</b>. End User A's Device <b>3568</b> communicates with the CICP <b>3554</b> as shown with arrows <b>3570</b> and <b>3572</b>. The CICP <b>3554</b> communicates bi-directionally with the Condition Database <b>3558</b> about the End User's condition, as shown with arrows <b>3574</b> and <b>3576</b>. The CICP <b>3554</b> also communicates with the Care Team Database <b>3562</b> in a bi-directional manner, as shown with arrows <b>3578</b> and <b>3580</b>, as well as with the Police/Rescue Team Database <b>3566</b> as shown with arrows <b>3582</b> and <b>3584</b>. Continuous bi-directional communications with the end user's personal database, shown for example at End User A Database <b>3560</b> and with arrows <b>3589</b> and <b>3590</b>.

<p id="p-0362" num="0361"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 110</figref> is an alternate embodiment that is an extension on the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 109</figref> embodiment and where a police officer or other authority person with a device, shown as, for example, Police Device <b>3594</b> that is connected to the CICP <b>3608</b>, which is like the CICP <b>3554</b> as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 109</figref>. As a police officer enters an area, location and/or context where, for example End User A referred to in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 109</figref> embodiment is located with his connected Device <b>3596</b> and with Other Users <b>3598</b> and the devices of the Other Users. In this instance, the system is established and operating as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 109</figref> when the police officer enters with his connected device, shown as “Police Device” <b>3594</b>, which communicates with the CICP <b>3608</b> as shown in bi-directional communication with arrows <b>3600</b> and <b>3602</b>. This Device <b>3594</b> is programmed to identify the End User A and/or his device when in proximity, as shown with arrows <b>3604</b> and <b>3606</b>. This programmed identification can be via BLE, WiFi signature, and/or a series or combination of readily available peer to peer protocols that are available when authorized by End User A and enabled on police devices. Once the connection is established, the End User A Device <b>3596</b> can authenticate the matching, as shown for example by a communication shown with arrow <b>3606</b>. Alternatively, the presence of the police officer in the same context as the End User can be detected by the CICP <b>3608</b>, as follows: the End User A's Device <b>3596</b> is connected to the CICP <b>3608</b> as shown with arrow <b>3610</b> and the context integration is confirmed via this communication. The Police Device communicates with the same CICP <b>3608</b>, via the communication shown by arrow <b>3600</b> and the CICP <b>3608</b> detects the context of the Device <b>3596</b> and which context is confirmed by the CICP <b>3608</b> and the information is transmitted to the Police Device <b>3594</b>, as shown with arrow <b>3602</b>. The CICP <b>3608</b> will therefore be able to detect when the Police Device and the End User A Device are in the same context, i.e., same location, proximity, area etc. Once the CICP <b>3608</b> has confirmed that they are in the same context via the proximity detection method between the two , as shown by arrows <b>3604</b> and <b>3606</b> or by cloud based pairing performed by the CICP <b>3608</b>, as shown with arrows <b>3610</b>, <b>3600</b> and <b>3602</b> this information about the interaction can be communicated to all parties. The police officer can receive collected information from the CICP <b>3608</b> as shown with arrow <b>3602</b>. This information can include data about the user <b>3612</b>, his condition <b>3614</b> as well as information about the user's care team <b>3616</b>. The police officer can also learn more information about other interactions with the end user that the Police/Rescue Team may have, as shown at <b>3618</b>. Any interaction with the police and information that is relevant and of value to the end user can also be delivered to the end user, as shown with arrow <b>3620</b>. Any, all and/or select information about the interactions between the police and the end user, can be retained, recorded and delivered to the Care Team and its Database <b>3616</b>, as shown with arrow <b>3622</b>, and any results of such communications can be communicated back to the CICP as shown with arrow <b>3624</b>. Any information relevant to the condition can be used to learn and study aspects of the condition, as shown with arrow <b>3626</b>, and the results can be communicated back to the CICP as shown with arrow <b>3628</b>. Conversely, information and data that are relevant to any of these interactions can be transmitted to the Police/Rescue Team Database <b>3618</b>, as shown with arrow <b>3630</b> and any relevant results can be transmitted back to the CICP as shown with arrow <b>3632</b>. Any and all information that is relevant to End User A can be recorded and retained by End User A in his Database <b>3612</b>, as shown with arrow <b>3634</b> with the ability to provide this information in future interactions with the CICP <b>3608</b> as shown with arrow <b>3636</b>, where the process can be repeated and the results and actions improved in future interactions when summary or aggregated information from the CICP <b>3608</b> can be transmitted to the End User A's Device <b>3596</b>, as shown with arrow <b>3638</b>.

<p id="p-0367" num="0366">Example Embodiment of Use of a Common CICP Using Various End User's Databases to Present Curated Content</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0367"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 114</figref> presents a schematic overview of a CICP system used to present curated content to end users based on their end user databases. In this embodiment of the platform, a CICP, shown as CICP N <b>3748</b> is used to present a series of curated experiences, herein illustrated as “Product/Offer/Service”, “Time”, “Availability”, “Quantity”, “Promotional Value” and “Upsell Opportunity” <b>3750</b> as a series of suggested features / parameters/quantifiers of the curated content and the way to assign values to each feature/parameter/quantifier that communicate with CICP N <b>3748</b> in bi-directional manner as shown with arrows <b>3752</b> and <b>3754</b>. When, for example End User A <b>3576</b> enters into an area that activates communication between End User A Device <b>3777</b> and CICP N <b>3748</b> in bi-directional communication shown with arrows <b>3836</b> and <b>3838</b>. This entry triggers CICP N <b>3748</b> to communicate with End User A Database <b>3782</b>, as shown with bi-directional communication arrows <b>3784</b> and <b>3786</b>. Based on this information, the CICP N <b>3748</b> will then communicate with “Product Offer/Service Database” <b>3788</b> in bi-directional manner as shown by arrows <b>3790</b> and <b>3792</b>. Based on computations performed by CICP N <b>3748</b>, based on parameters presented and communicated as shown with arrows <b>3752</b> and <b>3754</b>, and queries sent back and forth via communication links <b>3790</b> and <b>3792</b>, and <b>3784</b> and <b>3786</b>, curated content and experiences are presented to End User A Device <b>3777</b> as shown by arrow <b>3838</b> with a feedback loop to the CICP N <b>3748</b> with the results of how the End User A reacted to the curated content as shown with arrow <b>3836</b>. This result is then communicated to the End User A Database <b>3782</b> as shown with arrow <b>3786</b>. End User B, <b>3794</b> enters into an area that activates a communication with his Device <b>3790</b> and the same CICP N <b>3748</b> as shown with bi-directional communications <b>3796</b> and <b>3800</b>, simultaneously or after the communication between the CICP N <b>3748</b> and End User A. The results of presenting this curated content is then sent via link <b>3786</b> to End User A Database <b>3782</b>, recorded and retained for future use by End User A Database <b>3782</b>. The same process is performed by CICP N <b>3748</b> for End User B <b>3794</b> by connecting with End User B Database <b>3795</b>, instead of End User A Database <b>3782</b>, as shown with arrows <b>3802</b> and <b>3804</b> for End User B Database Communication.

<p id="p-0369" num="0368">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 115</figref>, an alternate embodiment, schematic overview shows how a CICP as shown and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 114</figref>, but referred to in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 115</figref> as CICP N <b>3806</b>, can be used to broker transactions between End User A <b>3808</b> via End User A Device <b>3810</b> and End User B <b>3812</b> and End User B Device <b>3814</b>. CICP N operates as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 114</figref>, but in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 115</figref> embodiment, End User A Database <b>3822</b> has received additional information from End User A, here illustrated as “Desire”, “Need”, “Funds”, “Promotional Value” and “Perceived Value” as shown at <b>3816</b>. This additional information is entered into and communicated bi-directionally with End User A Database <b>3822</b> as shown by arrows <b>3818</b> and <b>3820</b> and is further communicated to and from the CICP N <b>3806</b> as shown with arrows <b>3824</b> and <b>3826</b>. End user B <b>3812</b> has information/parameters as well, and is illustrated as “Desire to Sell”, “Need to Sell”, “Promotional Value”, “Funds” and “Perceived Value”, collectively shown at <b>3814</b>. These parameters are transmitted to the End User B Database <b>3834</b>, in bi-directional communications as shown with arrows <b>3830</b> and <b>3832</b>. End User A <b>3808</b> is in communication with CICP N <b>3806</b> as shown with arrows <b>3836</b> and <b>3838</b> and has a desire to purchase, acquire, trade or otherwise obtain something of value or experience or consume curated content from End User B, as communicated to End User A Device <b>3810</b> and bi-directional communications with the CICP N <b>3806</b> as shown with arrows <b>3836</b> and <b>3838</b>. End User A has described his desires and other aspects of the communications referred to at <b>3816</b>. The CICP N <b>3806</b> then will match these parameters with the data received from the End User B Database. Prior, simultaneous or later communications based on parameters then in CICP N <b>3806</b> will evaluate the data presented by End User B <b>3812</b> to End User B Database <b>3834</b> as shown with communication arrows <b>3830</b> and <b>3832</b>, and as transmitted to the CICP N <b>3806</b> as illustrated in bi-directional communications <b>3840</b> and <b>3842</b>. CICP N <b>3806</b> will then perform computations to present offers to End User A, as shown with arrow <b>3838</b>. The response from End User A is presented back to the CICP N, as shown with arrow <b>3836</b>. Should the response be an acceptance of the offer, this acceptance is communicated to End User B via the CICP N as shown with arrow <b>3844</b>, and the acceptance of the offer is presented to the CICP N via a communication shown with arrow <b>3846</b>, with a confirmation send to End User A via a communication shown with arrow <b>3838</b>. Should End User A not accept the offer, his counter offer can be submitted via communication shown with arrow <b>3836</b>, and then transmitted to the End User B via a communication shown with arrow <b>3844</b>, with the End User B responding back with acceptance or counter offer via a communication shown with arrow <b>3846</b>. This process can repeat until End User A and End User B arrive at acceptable transaction terms. The uniqueness of this alternate embodiment of the invention is the use of a common CICP to pair an entity/user that has something to sell or have something to offer and a user that has a desire to purchase something. This can translate to other transactions without the actual purchase of a product such as for services such as transportation where ride share and taxi services can use the same system.

<p id="p-0373" num="0372">Example of Use of Multiple CICPs, Expanded Teaching System</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0373"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 118</figref> is a schematic overview of the system described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 117</figref>, and expanded to include student devices, student databases, teacher devices and in-school sensors. In this embodiment, the system described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 117</figref> is operational, but with modifications as described here. A teacher <b>3936</b> works for a local government and has a device <b>3938</b> that is connected to a school's CICP system identified as “School SHCICP/MTCTCIP” <b>3940</b>, with bi-directional connections shown with arrows <b>3942</b> and <b>3944</b>. The “School SHCICP/MTCICP” <b>3940</b> is shown connected to a database for the teachers and identified as “Teacher Database” <b>3946</b>. The Teacher Database <b>3946</b> which is shown to be in direct bi-directional communication with School SHCICP / MTCICP <b>3940</b> via links <b>3948</b> and <b>3950</b> as well as indirectly with the “Local “N” Government MTCICP/SHCICP” <b>3952</b> as shown with bi-directional communication <b>3954</b> and <b>3956</b>. This enables the local “School SHCICP/MTCTCIP” <b>3940</b> to operate as the implementation explained with reference to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 117</figref> embodiment. The “School SHCICP/MTCTCIP” <b>3940</b> is also connected to and communicates with a database for the students shown as “Student Database” <b>3958</b>, and with which it is in bi-directional communication as depicted with arrows <b>3960</b> and <b>3962</b>. A series of students are shown to be in the same context as the teacher and to be in communication with the “School SHCICP/MTCTCIP” <b>3940</b> and with their communication devices, one of which is shown as “Student Device” <b>3966</b>, and in bi-directional communication with the “School SHCICP/MTCTCIP” <b>3940</b> with arrows <b>3968</b> and <b>3970</b>. This does not mean that the devices need to be in the same location. A series of additional curated education experiences have been created and stored in a database; “Experience/Motion Capture, AR/VR/MR Database” <b>3972</b>, which communicates with the “School SHCICP/MTCTCIP” <b>3940</b> in bi-directional communication as illustrated with links <b>3974</b> and <b>3976</b>. This same database is also in bi-directional communication with the “Central Government MTCICP” <b>3980</b> as shown with arrow <b>3978</b>, with the “State “N” Government MTCICP″ <b>3982</b> as shown <b>3984</b> and with the “Local “N” Government MTCICP/SHCICP” <b>3952</b> as shown with arrow <b>3988</b>. When “Student N” and the Teacher <b>3936</b> are in proximity, a verification of this proximity can be detected in two manners: one is via direct proximity detection between the two devices <b>3966</b>, <b>3938</b>, as depicted by links <b>3990</b> and <b>3992</b>. This proximity also can be determined via a series of known technologies such as BLE and/or other proximity/peer-to-peer technologies. A methodology to detect that the student and teacher are in the same context but not at the same location, i.e., they are not in proximity, for instance, they are in a distance learning situation with the teacher in one location and the student(s) is/are in another location is that the “School SHCICP/MTCTCIP” <b>3940</b> detects that both are in the same context and makes the pairing between the student and the teacher. Once the connection is made, the “School SHCICP/MTCTCIP” <b>3940</b> will alert the teacher as depicted with communication link <b>3944</b>. The teacher can then use her device to communicate and control the curated content delivery from the “School SHCICP/MTCTCIP” <b>3940</b>, from her device as depicted with arrow <b>3942</b>. The “School SHCICP/MTCTCIP” <b>3940</b> will then compute the curated content to be delivered by combining the data and input from the systems connected to it as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 117</figref>, as well as from the “Experience/Motion Capture, AR/VR/MR Database” <b>3972</b>, the “Teacher Database” <b>3946</b> and the “Student Database” <b>3958</b>, and serve this content to the student as depicted with arrow <b>3970</b>. The response to this curated content delivery is transmitted back to the “School SHCICP/MTCTCIP” <b>3940</b>, as shown with link <b>3968</b>. The content is recorded and retained by the “Student Database” <b>3958</b>, as shown with links <b>3960</b> and <b>3962</b>, by the “Teacher Database” <b>3946</b> as shown with arrows <b>3948</b> and <b>3950</b> and the system described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 117</figref> via the connection illustrated with arrows <b>3954</b> and <b>3956</b> to the MTCICP/SHCICP <b>3952</b>. The results are also presented to the Teacher Device <b>3938</b> as depicted with arrow <b>3944</b>. Should grading, feedback, comments, corrections, encouragement or other feedback be needed or warranted, the Teacher <b>3936</b> can communicate this via the “School SHCICP/MTCTCIP” <b>3940</b> as depicted through communication link <b>3942</b>, and with communication to the Student Device <b>3966</b> as shown with arrow <b>3970</b>, and transmission of the data/content to the Student Database <b>3958</b> via arrow <b>3960</b>, and to the Teacher Database <b>3946</b> via arrow <b>3948</b> as well as to the system described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 117</figref> via the link shown with arrow <b>3954</b>. Should the curated content that the “School SHCICP/MTCTCIP” <b>3940</b> determines a need to deliver to, or is instructed to deliver to the student needs additional functionality such as motion, movement, actions and body movement, exercises, AR/VR/MR experiences or any combination thereof, such content is stored on the “Experience/Motion Capture, AR/VR/MR Database”<b>3972</b> and will be communicated to the “School SHCICP/MTCTCIP” <b>3940</b> as shown with link <b>3974</b>. The “School SHCICP/MTCTCIP” <b>3940</b> will transmit this information to the Student Device <b>3966</b> as illustrated with arrow <b>3970</b>, with feedback delivered back to the “School SHCICP/MTCTCIP” <b>3940</b> as shown with arrow <b>3968</b>. The results are also presented to the Teacher Device <b>3938</b> as depicted with arrow <b>3944</b>. Should grading, feedback, comments, corrections, encouragement or other feedback be needed or warranted, the Teacher can communicate any of these to the “School SHCICP/MTCTCIP” <b>3940</b>, as depicted with arrow <b>3942</b>, with communication to the student through the Student Device <b>3966</b> via link <b>3970</b> and transmission of the data/content to the Student Database <b>3958</b> as shown with arrow <b>3960</b> and to the Teacher Database <b>3946</b> via link <b>3948</b> as well as to the system described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 117</figref> via link <b>3954</b>. Should Student N be in an environment where there are Sensors installed, these sensors can interact with the student's device(s), such as shown at <b>3966</b>, in bi-directional manner when enabled and possible, as depicted with arrows <b>3994</b> and <b>3996</b>.

This embodiment is for illustrative purposes and not intended to be all encompassing.</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0374">Convention Center Example</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0375">In such an embodiment, the convention center operator is in control of the MTCICP. Show managers will lease the physical location for a certain specific time and organize a show such as the ComiCon event at the San Diego Convention Center.</p>
<p id="p-0377" num="0376">This organizer then controls the MTCICP during the period they have agreed to pay for or otherwise compensate for.</p>
<p id="p-0378" num="0377">This show manager can now use the multi-tenant feature and further sub-lease access to the MTCICP system to exhibitors that are showcasing their products or content as a paid exhibitor. This exhibitor can then use the portion of the MTCICP they are granted access to. This can enable them to send messages and present content to those attendees that are in the exhibitor's booth at the time they are physically there.</p>
<p id="p-0379" num="0378">Likewise, a concessionaire that has a permanent installation in the convention center can be granted access to the MTCICP. Instead of a time restriction, they can be granted access to use only a portion of the MTCICP that accesses and interacts with attendees while they are in a predetermined area or granted access to control a specific area within the convention center where they can interact with attendees that have devices that are connected with the MTCICP. They can then offer content such as their food and drink menu to the attendees. This will be controlled by their access to the MTCICP and delivered from the MTCICP to the attendee's mobile device when the attendees are within the geographical area or specific area within the convention center. Such menu message can be programmed to launch an order system within the mobile device. The attendee can then place an order on their device. This order is sent to the MTCICP which then will transmit this order to a device in the concessionaire stand or a mobile device one of the staff members carry that is also connected to the MTCICP or to the Point of Sale system the concessionaire is using. A mobile payment for the order can also be accommodated through the same system in the same fashion. Systems such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay, MasterCard Pass or other payment systems can be incorporates into the MTCICP to handle the financial transaction portions.</p>
<p id="p-0380" num="0379">Similar to the concessionaire retailers, shops, restaurants, hotels, shopping malls, night clubs, tourist attractions, museums, private transportation, public transportation, airlines, taxi companies, tour organizations and others close by the convention center or otherwise associated with the attendees, tourism or safety, traffic, or city planning or management, can be granted access to communicate with the attendees by accessing the MTCICP. This access can be granted based on time, location or other per-determined parameters agreed upon by the master licensee of the MTCICP and the sub licensee. This access can be granted against no compensations, for compensation or for a participation of any commerce generated via the use of the MTCICP by all parties.</p>
<p id="p-0381" num="0380">A brand may also be interested in having access to the attendees while they are in town for the convention. Such access can be granted via access to the MTCICP. This access can then be granted for a limited time, but can work across all the geographical areas, including within the range of other sub-leases. The access can be limited to parameters in other fashions such as based on gender, age, interests, profession, position, wealth, type of car owned, level of authority, national origin for tourists and other parameters known within the MTCICP and its extended and connected databases.</p>
<p id="p-0382" num="0381">A service provider such as an organization or an airline or a cruise ship operator or an operator of a software or mobile app service can also be granted access to the attendees. Again, they will be granted access to control aspects of the MTCICP agreed upon by the parties in the same fashion as the brands described above.</p>
<p id="p-0383" num="0382">It will be very important to the owner of the MTCICP that all these entities do not inundate the attendees with offers and content in an intrusive, obnoxious or disruptive manner. Numerous ways to leverage and select the most relevant offer to present exists and can be incorporated into the MTCICP to ensure a limited number of offers and content are presented. Reverse “Dutch” auctions can be used and pre-programmed in a manner to programmatically present the offers that are most relevant and paying most to be displayed first.</p>
<p id="p-0384" num="0383">Such a platform can work for owners and operators of facilities such as the convention center mentioned, airports as described later, shopping malls, universities, stadiums, venues, hotels, city buildings, airlines, tourism agencies, city management, federal government, government agencies, web site and mobile service providers and law enforcement.</p>
<p id="p-0385" num="0384">Airport Example</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0385">Another embodiment of the MTCICP is for an airport operator. Modern airport operators have turn into landlords, leasing space to concessionaires and earning a percentage of their sales in addition to the lease they charge for the space. Airlines lease access to gates and typically no longer own these. In most modern airports, parking is one of the top revenue generators if not top. It is therefore in the interests to have happy travelers that spend as much time as possible walking in the airport, shopping and dining/eating/drinking after they have parked their car. A happy traveler spends a lot more than one that is stressed and rushed to get to their gate. The MTCICP can enable the airport to create a series of new revenue streams. It can lease access to the system to airlines, concessionaires, stores and restaurants, to tourism agencies, amusement parks, transportation companies, hotels, convention centers and any other entity that wants to communicate with travelers. This can be the advertisers and brands that pay for display ads in the airport, it can be products that are beings sold or the owners of the companies providing services for the airport.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0386">Regardless of the location that has the MTCICP the same functionality will be deployed and enabled.</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0387">The MTCICP will record all messages and content sent to the attendees, all the messages viewed, all the messages opened, all the messages acted upon. Should there be a call to action in the message such as open a message, follow a link to another page or to go to a physical location, the MTCICP system will record such an action and retain it.</p>
<p id="p-0389" num="0388">The system architecture of the MTCICP is based on the CICP “event-action-verify and record” method where all interactions with the systems are named as an event. This event is logged and it is determined if an action is warranted. Such actions can be a control command back to the system component that triggered, recorded and transmitted the event. If and when warranted the control command is sent to the appropriate device. This device can be the originating device, or any other connected device that has been associated with the originating device. In certain events, no action is warranted and no control commands are sent. In all instances, the event and any actions taken are verified to have been performed. The whole process is recorded and retained. The commands sent will trigger new events. These events are then matched against the desired outcome of the action. If the desired outcome was produced another event has occurred and the desired outcome has been verified. If the desired outcome was not produced, another event has occurred and the failure to achieve the desired outcome has been verified. All events and actions are recorded. What produces the desired outcomes will be repeated as needed and desired. The actions that do not result in the desired outcome will be retained and used by future similar events where other actions will be presented. The gathering of this date is the core of the intelligence component of the MTCICP.</p>
<p id="p-0390" num="0389">The events can be the gathering of data from individual set of sensors, a combination of sensors independently or numerous sensors combined into a device such as a mobile smart phone, the interactions between multiple sensors in geographical physical locations, the interactions of a connected device with one of multiple sensors, the interactions of a multiple connected mobile devices with a single sensor and/or the interactions of multiple sensors with multiple mobile devices, and/or the interactions between multiple mobile devices.</p>
<p id="p-0391" num="0390">The events can be based on proximity between a sensor and other sensors, the sensor and a mobile device, multiple sensors and a mobile device, the sensor and multiple mobile devices and/or multiple sensors and multiple mobile devices, and/or between multiple sensors, and/or between multiple mobile devices.</p>
<p id="p-0392" num="0391">The events can be based on time of the proximity of a sensor and other sensors, the sensor and a mobile device, multiple sensors and a mobile device, the sensor and multiple mobile devices and/or multiple sensors and multiple mobile devices, and/or between multiple sensors, and/or between multiple mobile devices.</p>
<p id="p-0393" num="0392">The events can be based on the location of the interactions of a sensor and other sensors, the sensor and a mobile device, multiple sensors and a mobile device, the sensor and multiple mobile devices and/or multiple sensors and multiple mobile devices, and/or between multiple sensors, and/or between multiple mobile devices.</p>
<p id="p-0394" num="0393">The events can be based on the person who is involved at the time, location or in the proximity of the sensor and other sensors, the sensor and a mobile device, multiple sensors and a mobile device, the sensor and multiple mobile devices and/or multiple sensors and multiple mobile devices, and/or between multiple sensors, and/or between multiple mobile devices.</p>
<p id="p-0395" num="0394">The event can be based on the person's background, shared profile, demographic profile, age, gender, interest, current behavior, past behavior, wellness, health, activity level, mood, the rate of travel, level of exercise, level of interest, personal danger, products around the person, the location of the person, other connected devices in proximity to the person, facilities such as buildings, homes, museums, venues, bars, restaurants, convention centers, hospital, stadiums, universities, airports, master planned communities, hotels and any other building structure, equipment around the person, equipment the person is using, riding, operating, driving, controlling, flying as the connections between any associated sensor and other sensors, the sensor and a mobile device, multiple sensors and a mobile device, the sensor and multiple mobile devices and/or multiple sensors and multiple mobile devices, and/or between multiple sensors, and/or between multiple mobile devices.</p>
<p id="p-0396" num="0395">The event can be based on the product the user is interacting with based on interactions between sensor and other sensors, the sensor and a mobile device, multiple sensors and a mobile device, the sensor and multiple mobile devices and/or multiple sensors and multiple mobile devices, and/or between multiple sensors, and/or between multiple mobile devices</p>
<p id="p-0397" num="0396">The event can be based on the user described above becomes in connection with another person who has another device connected to the MTCICP.</p>
<p id="p-0398" num="0397">This “event-action-verify-record” architecture enables the right messages to be delivered based on the context as described in the original description of the MTCICP.</p>
<p id="p-0399" num="0398">The actions that the MTCICP will deliver to the devices that are connected to it will be controlled and programmed by those that the master licensee has granted access to within the parameters that the master licensee and sub licensee have agreed upon for the compensation the parties have agreed upon during the time frames the parties agreed upon to the users and devices that the parties agreed upon, delivering the experiences, content, information and offers the parties agree upon within the parameters the parties agreed upon.</p>
<p id="p-0400" num="0399">The actions that the MTCICP can send can be offers to purchase, coupons for such offers, access, tickets, offers for service, special access or privileges, advertisements or alerts, alarms or encouragements. Actions can also be launching functions within communication device such as sounding an alarm, opening a camera view finder, launching a video, launching an AR browser, launching a QR code reader, trigger an NFC based event, launch a function within a software, trigger an event on the device. Actions can also be interactions with other equipment such as opening a door, grant access, punch a ticket stamp, trigger a video on a video display, dispense a product from a vending machine, trigger a payment, turn on a device, turn off a device, adjust music volume, adjust temperature settings and connect with any other connected devices.</p>
<p id="p-0401" num="0400">The content can be in—app, graphics, photos, images, videos. Content can be displayed as videos or photos, in augmented reality or virtual reality. Content can be displayed on the device, on equipment or video screens. All will be controlled, launched and triggered via commands from the MTCICP.</p>
<p id="p-0402" num="0401">The experiences, content and actions can be on the user's mobile devices or wearables that are connected to the MTCICP. They can be displayed on connected devices such as kiosks, vending machines, video screens or other connected display mediums.</p>
<p id="p-0403" num="0402">Where a facility has been installed with a complete MTCICP with numerous sensors or access points such as Wi-Fi access points and routers, beacons and other transmission devices such as LED lightbulbs with BLE, way finding solution can be implemented. In such an installation, the access points can be used to triangulate the location of any device that is connected to the MTCICP. Numerous system currently exists that can provide accurate locations based on such sensors. Solutions that detect location, way-finding and solutions that enable guided navigation from one point to another point within the facility are also available. Integration of these into the MTCICP enables the various users of the MTCICP to present offers within the navigation and guides presented back to the users of the system as they progress through the facility.</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0403">Since the MTCICP can detect the location of the users of the system within the geographical reach of the system which can range from global to precise in-door locations, if can guide interested parties to meet each other. This feature can be used by attendees at convention centers that are trying to locate and meet peers or co-workers, by a single person trying to locate another single person in an amusement park, a mother looking for her son at a university campus. Permission for such discovery will need to have been granted by both parties prior to such pairing. The MTCICP is the central hub and will retain such permission. The match making will only be enabled and allowed when both parties have consented to such pairing.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0404">When the pairing occurs between two or more consenting people who have devices that are connected to the MTCICP, an exchange of information between the two parties can be enabled by the MTCICP. The action of the connection of the two can be recorded and retained by the MTCICP as well as the transmission and sharing of the content.</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0405">Retail Chain Example</p>
<p id="p-0407" num="0406">One such implementation of the MTCICP can be in a retail environment. Here the retail chain has purchased a master MTCICP. They have installed a MTCICP system in each retail location. Each sub set of the MTCICP is controlled by the master MTCICP at the corporate HQ. The local store management has been granted limited access to control aspects of the system that is installed only in its physical location. Its sales staff has devices that are connected with the MTCICP. The devices that the staff carries in the store will transmit their location to the sub MTCICP. The store manager can then see the location of his staff from his device that has been granted another layer of access than the staff's devices. When a customer with a device that has a software or mobile app or otherwise has granted the retailer access to contact the customer enters the retail location, the event of this entry is recorded by the system. The MTCICP will then match this customer who has granted approval to be identified to the retailer and operator of the MTCICP with their profile that the retailer has on the customer. This profile can be a loyalty or reward program, a store credit card, a frequent buyer card, or other sources of user profiles the retailer retains on its customers. The MTCICP can also go to other connected databases to seek more information about the customer. Numerous sources for demographic data exist, as well as buying patterns from activities both on-line and off-line. This data will be aggregated by the MTCICP. The sum of this data will then be presented to the sub MTCICP system in the retail location. The location of the customer in the store will be monitored, recorded and retained. Should the customer stop at any place indicating that they have intent to understand, experience, touch, feel or try a product at that particular location within the premises; the MTCICP will detect such an action. Based on the dwell time the customer has at this location, a message can be sent from the MTCICP to a staff member or a number of staff members that are near-by. This message can be sent with back-ground information gathered by the MTCICP so that the staff member is well prepared when they initiate the verbal communication with the customer. When the staff member comes into proximity of the customer, the MTCICP system records this. Messages can be sent out to the other staff members that they do no longer need to look for the customer. Content that is relevant to the location can be presented by the MTCICP to the staff member so that the staff member can present stats or other features. The MTCICP can also send message and present content to the customer via his or her device that is connected to the MTCICP. Information such as comparisons, inventory level, options, features and functions can be presented in a sales promotional manner to the customer, while information about the product sent to the staff member has been created to assist in closing the sale. Thereby, the MTCICP is sending the right message to the right person, at the right time while they are both close to each other. All the data, the interactions, the customers dwell time at the product before the staff arrives, the time it took the staff member to arrive, the content sent to the customer and the content sent to the staff member will all be recorded and option to be displayed on the HQ and store manager level MTCICP. Digital displays can also be connected to the MTCICP. These can be programmed to present advertisements from brands that have paid to use the MTCICP. These ads can be displayed when a specific type of customer is in front of the display. The displays can also be movable, preprogrammed and connected. These can be tablets that are placed on fixed or movable display units that incorporate pre-programmed image recognition solutions. This image recognition solution can be connected to the MTCICP. The targets it is looking for can be selected and determined via the MTCICP by the store manager or the HQ or the brand owner who has been granted access against a fee. Once the image recognition system has made a match, content that is preloaded on the device can be triggered and displayed on the device. This interaction is an event and recorded as such by the MTCICP. The event can trigger an augmented reality representation of a product showcased in the target image, or it can be a promotional video, or an advertisement, a link to a web page, an interactive fact sheet, a presentation, photos, reviews, comparisons, data and fact sheets or any other aspect related to the image. All interactions are recorded and retained by the MTCICP. All results can be displayed as real time interactions on the store MTCICP or the HQ MTCICP.</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="0407">The data can be anonymized on the option of the MTCICP should this be need to comply with the retailer's privacy policies.</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0408">Healthy Lifestyle Promotion System</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0409">Preferred embodiments of the MTCICP may be configured to function to promote a healthy lifestyle, wellness encouragement, and verification and reward for healthy behavior while improving medical care, including pre- and post-surgical operation care with verification of medication and activity compliance.</p>
<p id="p-0411" num="0410">The invention can also be used to encourage behavior and actions, activity or purchases, verify that the desired action has been performed and then record and or reward for the desired behavior. If the desired behavior has not been achieved, corrective action can be presented, and the process repeated until the desired action has been taken. Additional messages, content delivery, alarms to send others to intervene, activity stop can be delivered as needed should it be needed to intervene.</p>
<p id="p-0412" num="0411">In another application of the central CICP, the MTCICP is extended beyond the delivery of content and experiences, it can be used to encourage healthy habits, drive wellness and improve the effectiveness of medical care and medication.</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0412">This invention is not dependent upon or based on the features and functions in a CICP platform, but it is preferred to be used in conjunction with such a CICP solution.</p>
<p id="p-0414" num="0413">This invention is a Health and Wellness CICP—HWCICP—which is to be used to connect and communicate with wearables such as the Samsung GearS2 watch, the Apple Watch, or other connected fitness and wellness tracking devices via a central CICP and or other connected mobile devices, sensors and connected equipment, display units and other equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0415" num="0414">This HWCICP is used to send specific health and wellness related messages. The objectives of such messages is to drive healthy behavior by sending motivational messages at the right time and on the right device, encouraging the user to make the right choices. These messages can then be answered by devices that can determine if the action was taken. This action can be to run faster, lift a weight, flex and arm or kick a ball. When the action has been completed, it can be recorded and if a reward is appropriate it can be awarded. A point can be collected and retained in a loyalty database connected to the CICP.</p>
<p id="p-0416" num="0415">It is an established fact that it takes more than 21 days to make a habit permanent. With this system, reminders can be sent at the right time. Rewards can be granted for the right behavior. This will then be repeated until a decreasing number of scheduled reminders are omitted. If the behavior remains, then the habit has been established. Rewards can be used as incentives along the process. Games can be used to encourage the right behavior. Such games can be made public or shared with a select group to instill competition.</p>
<p id="p-0417" num="0416">In certain settings and facilities such as office buildings, it can be of benefit to the owner and or operator of the facility that those that are in the facility are as healthy as possible. In office settings, an in active work in front of a compute can cause obesity. Simple reminders to stand up and be active are common features on wearable devices and mobile phones such as S-Health by Samsung and Apple Health by Apple. Such a device can be connected to the HWCICP which can then be connected with sensors in the facility. Now messages can be directed to those that are standing in front of an elevator. These messages can be to take the stairs instead. Only those that are standing by the elevator will get the message, while those that are walking by and continue on will not. Those that actually climb the stairs or walk down the stairs can be awarded. This action can be determined and recorded via proximity beacons in the stairwell, or by the activity sensors on the devices. The HWCICP will record and award rewards and points according to set parameters. These parameters can be defined and included in the message about taking the stairs.</p>
<p id="p-0418" num="0417">Likewise, the same system can be used to detect if a person is in front of a water cooler or water fountain. If they walk by, nothing happens. If they stop by the fountain or water cooler for a given period of time, the system can detect this and send a message to drink water. The action of standing by the water cooler or water fountain for a period of time—dwell time—can be used as verification that the person is drinking water. Such an event will be recorded by the HWCICP and points awarded.</p>
<p id="p-0419" num="0418">Likewise, the same system can be used to make healthy food choices while in front of a snack food vending machine or in line to order food in the cafeteria at the facility. Suggestions on what to order can be presented on the users connected device by the HWCICP which detects the actual location. Message can be to present the menu of the cafeteria or option to connect with the vending machine. Should the user select an item from the cafeteria menu, the order will be gathered by the HWCICP. The event is recorded and the action will be to send that order to the Cafeteria system. This can be the cafeteria ordering system, a POS system, a dedicated device at the cafeteria or on the connected device of some of their staff. Such devices will be connected via the HWCICP with whatever connectivity they have. IN the case of the vending machine, the connection can be made directly or via cloud based servers and control system that can connect with the HWCICP.</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0419">Near Field Communication (NFC) tags can be placed at specific locations. When such a tag is triggered by a HWCICP connected device, the system can detect that an action related to that NFC tag has occurred and be recorded by the HWCICP in the user's profile. This tag can be placed by a certain food in a cafeteria, by a turn still at an entry to a facility or on specific exercise equipment. The pairing of these tags can be used to determine what food the user is selecting in a cafeteria, what entry to the building they use (stairs or elevator) or what type of exercise the user is engaging in—is it a leg lift or arm curling machine.</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="0420">Connected displays in the facilities can also present the messages as the users move past and stand in front of these devices. Special motivational messages can be displayed personalized to the person standing in front of the display. The user's personal communication device that is connected with the HWCICP will detect that the user is in proximity to the display. The display is also connected to the HWCICP. Once the pairing between the two connected devices has occurred, appropriate messages based on the programming of the HWCICP and any past demographical data and or profiles of the user, the location of the display and the activity around it.</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="0421">The system can also present motivational messages delivered by respected people such as athletes, at the right time and place. Audio messages such as the famous Eye of the Tiger from the Rocky movies can be triggered on mobile devices as the user comes to the 3<sup>rd </sup>floor in a flight of stairs.</p>
<p id="p-0423" num="0422">Directional messages and both the display and the user's connect devices can offer the user to take the stairs to the 2<sup>nd </sup>floor rather than the elevator.</p>
<p id="p-0424" num="0423">As today's young generation is heading to be the first generation in recorded history to have a shorter life expectancy than its parents based on lifestyle choices, the HWCIC can be used to motivate activity, encourage healthy eating habits and monitor sleep. Using HWCIC to create gamification away from video games and TV screens that drives sedentary life style in the younger generation can be enabled to counter sedentary lifestyle. The same gamification can be used for today's office workers also sit at long period in front of computers. The ability to create messages such as encouraging activities and assigning points to these is a simple way to gamify—scavenger hunts that requires walking is a simple aspect. A more detailed and engaging feature can be to fit professional athletes or action movie stars with sensors and then track them as they perform their routines, shoot their baskets, score goals, run, ski, jump or do action movie motions. These actions can be recorded via body sensors and or video capture systems and captured in a HWCIC enabled platform. These actions then are recorded and retained. A user with a device such as a wearable, set of wearables, and or other sensors, can then try to replicate the movements, actions and or motions. Their performance is recorded and retained by their HWCIC connected devices. The user can then see how she or he compares in their motions against the expert. This can be against a set time, number or repetitions, speed, strength or accuracy that the expert achieved. The match and score against the expert can be presented on the user's HWCIC device real-time with an encouragement to repeat and improve. The experience can also be replayed or acted with virtual reality googles to create an immersive experience. The expert could have been filmed in a real world environment using one of the numerous 3D cameras with 360 degree capture. The same methodology can be used to enable participants to compete with each other. In such an instance each player has a device or devices connected to the HWCIC. Each player is identified in the HWCIC to compete against each other and each other have granted permission to the HWCIC and each other to participate and influence the game. The same methodology can be used to improve one's own game or performance. The initial run-through of the process can be completed using sensors that capture the motions such as motion capture sensors, and the actions and motions are recorded into the HWCIC. At a later time, the same motions are performed and the way these are performed can be matched real-time against what had been captured by the HWCIC in the previous instance. This can be used to improve a user's own performance, or the HWCIC can be a multi-tenant CICP where a sports team has the controls. They can then grant access to their trainers, medical, sports agents and others to monitor performance, monitor and verify improvements and detect where there may be problems. Corrective actions, suggested improvements and other actions can be programmed into the HWCIC to assist in behavior change.</p>
<p id="p-0425" num="0424">The HWCIC can also be used to suggest and recommend healthy eating habits. Time to consume food and drinks, vitamins, medications, supplements and the frequency and amounts of these can be programmed into the HWCIC. The HWCIC can then send messages and alerts about what to consume, and when and how much via HWCIC connected devices that the user has with him, is wearing or are within his context. He can confirm via the HWCIC connected devices that he has consumed the products or performed the actions. The HWCIC will retain and record this confirmation. Points can be assigned for the positive actions and retained by the HWCIC. Points can be deducted for failure to perform. Point status can be displayed on the user's device, on a public device or devices that are connected via the HWCIC and are permitted to see this information by the user, his team, his boss or employers, agents, teams, trainers, medical staff, supporters. As the action has been verified by the HWCIC, in addition or in-lieu of awarding points, the HWCIC can send an action to a sensor on the user to take a reading of his condition. This can be vital stats such as taking a heart rate pulse, moisture levels to measure sweat, blood sugar, glucose levels, oxygen levels or rate of speed of travel direction, height above ground, length of time airborne, power in turns and/or any other performance data and/or other stats on the conditions of the user. This can be used to measure levels of performance, accuracy or if the user may appear to have fallen, is there a pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0426" num="0425">Consumption of the right food groups can also be encouraged via the HWCIC. When a user with a HWCIC connected device enters a grocery store, a restaurant, hotel, venue, airport or other place where he is likely to consume food and drinks, he can be reminded to select what is healthy. Confirmation that he chooses correct can be automatically in instances where a product packaging has a feature that includes an image recognizable by the HWCIC or a NFC tag that is associated with the product when this match is done in a manner recognized by the HWCIC. Offers to purchase healthy food can be provided with manual or automatically points awarded for right choices. This confirmation can be via object recognition systems, QR codes on the product packaging, NFC tags on the product. It can be confirmed via integration into the retailers POC system. It can be via product confirmation from devices such as Samsung fridge system that detects what products are in the fridge.</p>
<p id="p-0427" num="0426">The same HWCIC can also be used to connect to devices and or sensors that the user wears while sleeping or have placed in his bed, in his room or in his proximity where he sleeps. Alerts and reminders to start to rest and slow down can be imitated via the HWCIC before the person needs to go to sleep. This can be motivational messages, turning on soothing audio sounds, running a hot bath, preparing a warm tea—all triggered and controlled via the HWCIC system that has been integrated into the user's home or hotel room or wherever he is sleeping.</p>
<p id="p-0428" num="0427">The sensors can determine the quality of the sleep, the length and effectiveness. There are numerous solutions in the marketplace from wearables, to sensors in beds, to units to place on night stands. Any and all that are connected via Wi-Fi and has permissions via protocols to connect with other systems can be connected to the central HWCIC. The HWCIC thereby creates a multi-tenant HWCIC Smart home integration and master system.</p>
<p id="p-0429" num="0428">Points can be assigned at each step of the process from waking up in the morning, eating breakfast, exercise, drive to work, take stairs at work instead of elevator, snack at work at certain times, drink water at certain times, stand at certain times, choose healthy food at lunch, remain active, drink more water, eat a snack, take stairs, walk to car, eat healthy dinner, stretch, relax before bed, go to bed at the right time, sleep well—and repeat.</p>
<p id="p-0430" num="0429">The ability to monitor lifestyle and encourage healthy choices is also of great value to medical insurance companies, employers and educational institutions. Once such embodiment of the invention is for a medical insurance company that encourages their members to go to a fitness gym. Such a program may give a discount to the member if he goes to the gym twice a week and are quite common place. When the insurance company implements a HWCIC to manage this program, the verification that the member goes to the gym can be automatically recorded. Each time and the number of times he enters the gym can be detected via geofences around the gym, beacon in the gym or NFC or other sensors in their facilities. These will interact with the member's mobile devices or wearables or sensors that are connected to the HWCICP. These interactions are recorded and retained as a proof of presence. The HWCICP can also be used to verify that the member is actually exercising by opening a heart right sensor or motion sensor that records movement and activity take a recording, record and retain this. This data can be retained by the HWCICP in the user's profile and or can be retained and recorded in a manner that remains anonymous. The action of going to the gym, the frequency, the times entering and exiting, the time there can all be recorded and retained by the HWCICP. Equipment, shoes, wearables and other sports and exercise tools can be fitted with sensors such as NFC tags or QR codes to validate, verify and record the use of these by the member via a connected wearable or mobile device that can communicate with the HWCICP or can retain the information for a period of time while out of range for communication with the HWCICP and transmit the collected, recorded and retain information and data when the connection is re-established with the HWCICP.</p>
<p id="p-0431" num="0430">The rewards for the activity at the gym can be a reduction in monthly medical insurance bills. The HWCICP can grant access to the gym attendance information, and the performance data there if user has granted rights to this to the accounting department of the insurance company. Alternatively, the HWCICP can be integrated into the insurance company accounting department database systems triggering a reduction in premiums for the user.</p>
<p id="p-0432" num="0431">Hospital Example</p>
<p id="p-0433" num="0432">The same MTCICP system can be used in a hospital facility. In such an instance, the customer is a patient, the staff is nurses, and the store admin is replaced by the hospital admin staff. Instead of recording when standing in front of products, the patient's location will be mapped as he moves from examination room to examination room to laboratory and other facilities across the hospital. Instead of presenting content about a product, the MTCICP can present information about the patient. Should the hospital have a HIPPA compliant version of the MTCICP, electronic health records can be presented to the nurses, admins and physicians who have HIPPA compliant mobile devices that are connected to the MTCICP when they are in proximity to the patient. The path and movement of the patient can be recorded and retained by the HIPPA compliant MTCICP platform.</p>
<p id="p-0434" num="0433">This system can also be extended to patient care post operations. There is a big issues currently regarding re-admit within 30 days of discharge. It is of great importance to the physicians to ensure that patients make the follow up appointments with their primary care physician within 48 hours of discharge. It is also of great importance that the patient follows the routines and regiments of care required and prescribed by the discharge physicians and nurses. The proper intake of the prescribed medicine in right dosage at the right time is also vital. Finally, there is a need to inform and educate the patient about the procedure the just had performed, with a mean to contact the right care give should the patient have any concerns or if problems occur.</p>
<p id="p-0435" num="0434">The use of a MTCICP system can enable these things to happen. A patient that is being discharged will typically receive a print out of the their prescribed medications, paper forms with instructions, phone directory on a paper or phone book and other written notes and documents printed on paper. A MTCICP solution can add to this with a tablet that has been pre-programmed with all the relevant information around the procedure. Links to websites, videos and other information can be pre-programmed into this tablet. The user interface can be customized for easy navigation for seeing impaired people, elderly or those with limited dexterity in their hands and arms. Voice or gesture controls can also be included in this tablet.</p>
<p id="p-0436" num="0435">The tablet is connected with the MTCICP via cellular network so it is always connected. Easy to use tabs to connect the patient with the care team can also be included. Once the patient makes a request for connection, the connection will be made via the MTCICP or in such a fashion that the MTCICP captures and records the connection attempt. It can ensure that the right care giver is connected. If that care giver is also part of the MTCICP, he or she can have a mobile device that is connected to the MTCICP and alerts the care giver when the request for contact has been made by the patient. As part of the discharge kit a wearable such as a Samsung Gear S2 watch can be given, lent, sold or leased to the patient. This device is also connected via cellular network to the MTCICP. As part of its preloaded mobile application, the MTCICP can open up sensors on this device upon certain events. These events can be event such as when acceleration is recorded by the device which the on-board chips will calculate to indicate that the wearer of the watch has fallen. Then the watch can sound an alarm to alert the user, it can make a connection to the MTCICP and sound an alarm via its connections, it can open up its heart rate sensor and take 2 readings, and seek any other motions or sounds. If these indicate a fall and that the wearer of the watch is in distress, the watch can send an emergency alert to the MTCICP and call 911. Since the unit has a cell unit and SIM card in it, the MTCICP can route a voice call to the unit and the 911 operator can also engage a voice call. Since the unit operates on the cell network, location can be detected and ported to the 911 service. The unit can also present medication alerts and reminders in non-emergency situations. These can be triggered by the MTCICP and displayed on the watch face with an alarm and vibration trigger. The patient can acknowledge that he is taking the medication. Such a response can be retained by the MTCICP as an indication that the patient is complying with the medication regiment prescribed. If of interest to the prescribing physician or discharge team, the watch can be programmed to take a hear rate reading before the message is sent, and after the patient has confirmed that he has consumed the medication. All such recordings will be recorded and retained by the MTCICP. Should the patient want to contact some of his care givers, the connections can be presented via the MTCICP. Such a message can be similar to a “nurse call” button in the hospital room, with the direct connection to on-staff nurses enabled. It is of great interest to the medical team, the hospital administrator and other care givers and family members that the patient can get the appropriate care at the right time. Early warning signs of a worsening condition can be detected earlier and prevented. One such issue is rapid weight gain post heart operation. Should a scale with the ability to be connected via WiFi or cellular network be prescribed as part of the discharge kit, reminders to measure weight and recording of these can detect warning signs before they become life threatening. Any other connected device that measures health statics or data can be connected with the MTCICP. Nearly equally important to the hospital operators, owners and admins is to intercept patients that are returning to the hospital or any other care giver within the 30 days without a critical need. The hospital that performed the operation may in such an instance forfeit the payment for the original operation and or be subject to a fine. In many instances, it may be more economical to send a trained professional nurse or doctor or other care giver to the location that the patient is at. The MTCICP can assist in administrating and coordinating such efforts to preemptive intercept an early re-admit. Any such staff member that has a device that is connected to the MTCICP and is on duty can be directed to go to the location of the patient to ascertain if the patient really needs to be readmitted. The MTCICP can also be used to enable additional uses of the discharge kit components such as smart home controls via gesture controls of the Samsung Gear S2 with the MTCICP capturing all interactions, with the ability to detect trends such as diminishing activity levels or weaker movements. Such trends can cause the MTCICP to send an alert to care givers.</p>
<p id="p-0437" num="0436">While the MTCICP can interact with people and their devices, it can also be used to track, locate and detect proximity of products, assets, equipment and other items of value that can be moved or are designed to be moved.</p>
<p id="p-0438" num="0437">In the hospital setting, asset tracking is a big issue. Equipment is mobile and often needed in an emergency resulting in no actual tracking of where it was taken from, how long it was used and where it was placed after it was no longer needed for that particular situation.</p>
<p id="p-0439" num="0438">Such equipment can have a sensor placed on it. This sensor could be a Bluetooth LE sensor. This sensor is associated with the equipment in the MTCICP. Whenever a member of staff that has a device that is connected with the MTCICP comes in proximity to that specific piece of equipment, that interaction is recorded and retained by the MTCICP. It will retain the information about the equipment, where the staff member was when the interaction started, the time it occurred, how long it lasted and at what time the proximity ended and where the staff member was at that time. The location of the piece of equipment is thereby detected, recorded and retained by the MTCICP and can instantly or at a later time be displayed in the MTCICP or on any other device connected with the MTCICP that has the right credentials to have access to this information. This ‘last known location’ is another aspect of the MTCICP.</p>
<p id="p-0440" num="0439">Such an MTCICP system can also track, locate and alert about assets in locations without the MTCICP infrastructure of sensors. Such an embodiment can be the use of the MTCICP for baggage tracking and alerts. A Bluetooth LE beacon can be placed on a piece of baggage and identified via a mobile device that has an app that communicates with the MTCICP. It can be logged as related to that specific device and the specific piece of luggage and recoded as such in the MTCICP. Once the traveler checks in his luggage at the departing airport, the proximity is broken and recorded and retained by the MTCICP. Once the traveler arrives at is arrival airport, his device will recognize the location as an airport via geo-fences preprogrammed in the MTCICP. It will start listening for the BLE beacon assigned with the person's device. Once the luggage arrives on the luggage conveyer belt, proximity is detected and the mobile device will sound an alarm, shake or otherwise alert the user that his luggage has arrived and is ready to be collected. Should the first airport be a connecting airport, the user will not connect with his luggage and the alert is not sent. All of these events and actions are transmitted to the MTCICP and recorded with location and time—and retained.</p>
<p id="p-0441" num="0440">Another embodiment of the MTCICP is the ability to present actions such as enabling on-device order of products such as food and beverages when in proximity to a facility that has a MTCICP connection. The mobile device is then also connected to the MTCICP and when the user approaches the facility, the menu can be presented. In app and on the device selection of the products can be recorded by the device and the selection presented as an order on the device. Once confirmed by the user, the order will be transmitted to the MTCICP. The MTCICP will then transmit the order to the facility's connect devices. This can be a display, a mobile device that is fixed or mobile, a mobile device used by some of the staff member or directly into the facility's point of purchase system. Any of these systems will be connected to the MTCICP and will send a confirmation message back to the originating device. Information about the person that placed the order will also be transmitted to the facility via the MTCICP. This can be a photo of the user or the identification of the user's mobile device. A payment for the products ordered can also be facilitated via the MTCICP. Using any of the multiple mobile payment solutions such as Apple Pay or Google Pay, the tender can be closed when the user receives the products ordered. In one such instance, a 27 year old male person visiting from another town has a mobile watch such as a Samsung Gear S2 watch. Once he enters a crowded bar that has access to a MTCICP and installation in place, he is presented an offer to order a Coke and Bacardi on his wrist watch. He presses yes, and the MTCICP transmits the order to the bar tender's personal mobile device that is also connected to the MTCICP. He confirms receipt of the order and sees the FaceBook profile photo of the user. As the user approaches the bar, the bartender recognizes him and hands him his drink. The user acknowledges receipt of his drink on his watch and the tender is closed and payment arranged via the MTCICP. In this instance, Bacardi had access to the MTCICP. They have paid the owner of the system to be allowed to present offers for drinks using Bacardi Rom to male persons travelling that are between age of 25 and 30. This is why the offer for the Bacardi was presented instead of an offer for a Vodka martini. The order includes a handling fee that is automatically included in the cost. This is shared by the owner of the MTCICP and the facility in a predetermined revenue share agreement. The order also includes an automatic % for tip that will be paid to the bar staff. In another impediment of the same MTCICP order solution, a busy mom is travelling with her twin 3 year old boys. She arrives at the airport where the MTCICP has been installed. The MTCICP has guided her through the shortest lines through security. She has signed up for a health and fitness tracker version of the system. Her pulse is recorded as she has passed through security. The struggles with security and 2 unruly three year old boys have caused her stress levels to be elevated. The MTCICP recognizes this elevated stress level. It matches her with her profile of being a mother of young children. A newsstand is located across the gate where she has sat down with her boys trying to calm them. There are no food concessionaires at this area of the airport. Her watch pings her gently. It displays a message on the display asking if she could use a bottle of water and some packages of fruits for her boys that has been sent from the MTCICP.</p>
<p id="p-0442" num="0441">She states yes. This confirmation is now sent to the newsstand that carries both via the MTCICP. The order is confirmed via the system and displayed on the woman's watch. An option to have this delivered to her is offered at a fee, and she confirms she wants this. This request is again sent via the MTCICP to the newsstand. The order is now carried by a staff member or other service provider who has a device that is connected to the MTCICP. The location of the woman is shown on the device this staff member has with her. Once the connection is made, the order is closed and payment procured in the preferred manner of the woman; cash, credit card or via the MTCICP enabled watch.</p>
<p id="p-0443" num="0442">As this woman is waiting for her flight, the MTCICP enabled watch pings her saying the Southwest airline is delayed and there is a gate change. She now moves to this new gate with her two sons in tow. They are all getting hungry, but she does not want to risk leaving the gate. Now she uses her mobile phone that is also connected to the MTCICP to see what restaurants are close by inside the airport and offer the same delivery service. She can see a couple of fast food restaurants nearby, but the lines are long and boys even more on edge. She finds a healthy alternative in a restaurant in the opposite side of the terminal. She places an order for a salad for herself and two healthy sandwiches and apples for her boys. She selects “deliver to me” and “initiate beacon tracking” on her phone. The order and the action are transmitted to the MTCICP. The “initiate beacon tracking” feature of the MTCICP enabled app opens up the BLE signal transmitter on the phone. The ID of the phone is retained by the MTCICP and included with the order. As the order has been transmitted, placed and processed at the restaurant, all this information is sent to the person carrying the food. His MTCICP connected device has a map of the area where the woman is. But this is a very crowded area with frustrated and delayed travelers. Everyone is on edge because of the two hungry and unruly boys. The server will use his device to see signal strength of the BLE signal being transmitted from the woman's phone. As he gets closer, the signal gets stronger, should he move in the wrong direction, it gets weaker. They meet up quickly despite the crowded area.</p>
<p id="p-0444" num="0443">The man who ordered the food earlier is also delayed. He is a business traveler and has his entire luggage with him as hand luggage making it hard to reach his phone.</p>
<p id="p-0445" num="0444">He has his flight details included in his MTCICP connected mobile app on the phone. Now as he approaches the display banks of the flights, the beacon that is associated with that specific display that is also connected to the MTCICP recognizes that he is in proximity to this display. This verification that he is in front of this particular display will be recorded by the MTCICP. It will match him with his flight information that is retained by his mobile device. As he approached his flight number will be instructed from the MTCICP to flash, have a name by it, have his initials by it, have a border around it, be highlighted or some other ways be made to stand out. This will last for a duration programmed and determined by the MTCICP. It can be based on how many other people who also have devices that are connected to the MTCICP are standing in front of that display. It can be flashing as long as he stands there and stop when he walks away. It can be on for a few seconds. His device that is connected to the MTCICP can be programmed to import the flight gate information onto the device. Indoor way finding can then be provided by the MTCICP to guide the user to his gate.</p>
<p id="p-0446" num="0445">Another embodiment of the MTCIC is in use for operations of facilities, venues, airports, hospitals, restaurants, office buildings, convention centers and other buildings. In such instances, it can be used by the owners or management of the building, staff on site, contracted staff, electricians, managers, sanitation, room service, housekeeping, maintenance, service providers.</p>
<p id="p-0447" num="0446">This MTCICP can then be used by the operator of the facility with access granted to various contractors and departments. This can be used to communicate with professionals when there is a problem at a certain location. It can be used to alert about equipment failures or damages. This can range from a faulty faucet or overflowing WC, a broken pipe or a spill of liquids on a floor, to faulty escalator, elevator or moving walkway, a broken window, or other structural damages. It can be an issue such as a fire, a person that is hurt or ill, a person that needs service, a person that needs help moving in a wheel chair, temperature that is too high or too low, it can be a piece of electronic equipment or display or tool that is malfunctioning. When such an event is recorded as an issue of concern via sensors that are connected to the MTCICP, or sensors that can alert other devices that are connected to the MTCICP such as a mobile device used by those in the vicinity of the issue, or the user of such a mobile device activates the issue of the concern, the MTCICP records this issue as an event. The event then triggers an action or series of actions. Such an action can be to alert the staff that has devices that are connected to the MTCICP that and are in proximity to the event or has some other interaction or control or authority of the event. This alert will then be displayed on the staff member's mobile device that is connected to the MTCICP. Content, instructions and information about the issue at hand can be delivered as well so that the staff member is fully informed and educated about the issue at hand. When the staff member has acknowledged that he is addressing the issue the MTCICP will also record and retain this information. Should the staff member be unable to fix, correct or handle the issue, he can use his device that is connected to the MTCICP to alert staff members to assist. The MTCICP will then send messages to these via their connected devices with actions to take. The MTCICP can also escalate issues of importance to those with a higher authority or to the master license holder or the owner of the MTCICP based on predetermined algorithms, alert triggers or if-then commands.</p>
<p id="p-0448" num="0447">The MTCICP can also be used to ensure that personnel are performing the tasks they are supposed to perform. This can be cleaning a room or restroom, servicing a vending machine, maintaining a piece of equipment, checking a certain area for intruders or problems, checking in with a patient, guest or inmate, checking the function of measuring meters, sensors, doors, gates, bridges, areas, roofs, cellars, back-yard, courtyards or other areas. When the personnel are in these areas, the MTCICP can record that the person is there, when the person entered and when the person left. If there is a security issue, the MTCICP can open up the microphone on the connected device to listen to ambience noise or any noise that may indicate danger such as yelling, screaming, breaking of glass, squeals of brakes, gun shots or it can open up camera units on the connected device or it can open up heart monitors on the devices or other sensors on the devices that are connected to the MTCICP to determine the level of danger or threat or security risk. The MTCICP can then send alerts or messages or alarms to the level of reinforcement, repairs, law enforcement, emergency care or supervisor level in case of less urgent or less threat situations. It can be sent to those who are close by the issue event or those far away that need to come to assist such as law enforcement, ambulance or fire brigade.</p>
<p id="p-0449" num="0448">Aggregated Hub Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0450" num="0449">Preferred embodiments of the MTCICP may also be configured to include combinations of CICPs systems with sensors and devices that combine on-board, on-device computation algorithms with calculation results communicated via aggregation hubs. The aggregated CICP computing hubs preferably communicate through a common CICP central data gathering and computation site. The common CICP site is preferably and optionally integrated into a common interface, preloaded onto numerous connected devices and/or included as a part of an operating system that can enable the interactions of the physical world with the digital world.</p>
<p id="p-0451" num="0450">As described in regard to some preferred embodiments, the CICP gathers data from sensors that communicate with the central CICP. In alternate embodiments sensors are housed within common communication devices such as a mobile smart phone where accelerometers, manometers, gyroscopes, microphones and camera sensors are used to determine numerous aspects of context. In these alternate embodiments and instances, numerous embedded and off-the-shelves algorithm solutions to detect orientation, accelerations, impact, image recognition, ambient noise, walk-run-stand, heart rate and step counters exists. Each device has a series of predetermined and pre-loaded algorithms to determine these.</p>
<p id="p-0452" num="0451">Another alternate embodiment is a Sensor Hub based CICP (SHCICP) system that provides a communication platform system that incorporates computation hubs based on computers, connected banks of servers and or super-computers are programmed to detect and learn context and take desired and programmed actions based on the determined context. The system can be program to present recommendations, deliver content, and interact with devices and control environments. The SHCICP collects data from one or numerous connected devices.</p>
<p id="p-0453" num="0452">As also described herein, alternate embodiments include a sub sensor based hub connected CICP system structure that is used to provide intelligent contextual data detection on a smaller chip, device or equipment and then sends the resulting action as a command to a central communication hub that is connected with to a central SHCICP. This transmitting CICP can collect action commands from numerous sub CICPs. It can use its own computation power to transmit collective results to the master CICP.</p>
<p id="p-0454" num="0453">This above described alternate embodiment can also include a series of small sensors on a person's body such as on a NFL football player's body during play or practice. In this alternate embodiment each sensor has collections of chips that are connected to a master computational chip that has been pre-preprogrammed with algorithms to take the input from the various chips to detect a predetermined set or sets of action or actions.</p>
<p id="p-0455" num="0454">This device then can transmit the results of its on-chip on-sensor to the communication component of the sensor. This can be a low power low range low power consumption communication module such as a BLE. This follows the principle of the CICP—take input, select and calculate actions on this input—and then transmit the result.</p>
<p id="p-0456" num="0455">In this embodiment, the result from this sub SHCICP sensor is transmitted to a central hub. This central hub can take input from numerous other sub SHCICP sensors. This central communication hub SHCICP will then communicate via to a more powerful communication method such as a WAN, WWI or 3G, LTE, 4G, 5G or other communication network to a more powerful SHCICP.</p>
<p id="p-0457" num="0456">In such an event, the NFL player can have multiple sensors such as on shoes, in his helmet, in knee-braces, woven in the materials of his uniform, heart rate monitor, blood oxygen measurement, moisture sensors, tactile sensors in gloves, pressure sensors in the shoes, camera on his helmet, contact lenses in his eyes, head up display in his visor and any additional new type sensors that might become available.</p>
<p id="p-0458" num="0457">Each unit calculates its own sensor data and transmits it calculation result to a central communication hub.</p>
<p id="p-0459" num="0458">This hub can be a larger unit placed in the belt of the player's uniform, in his shoulder pads or on the helmet. Ideally it will be placed in a location that helps facilitate the transmission of the data it calculates.</p>
<p id="p-0460" num="0459">It will take the input from each of the sensors on the player and combine all of these inputs into its own on-chip SHCICP calculation chip.</p>
<p id="p-0461" num="0460">The results of this aggregated data will be transmitted to a central SHCICP.</p>
<p id="p-0462" num="0461">This central SHCICP can be placed in a training facility.</p>
<p id="p-0463" num="0462">There are numerous other NFL players on the same field at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0464" num="0463">Each player has been outfitted with the same system.</p>
<p id="p-0465" num="0464">Each player's hub communicates its specific aggregated data from its player to the central stadium SHCICP.</p>
<p id="p-0466" num="0465">This is thereby a fully embedded SHCICP that connects the team in a fashion called “Contextually Connected Team”, referred to as a “CCT”.</p>
<p id="p-0467" num="0466">The SHCICP component of the CCT can display results of its calculations on devices that are connected to it such as a tablet, mobile phone or other communication devices.</p>
<p id="p-0468" num="0467">For deeper and more complicated calculations, the central SHCICP unit of the CCT can transmit its collected data to a cloud based server. This cloud based server can be connected to a super computer for further calculations.</p>
<p id="p-0469" num="0468">These calculations can be combined with past data collected from the CCP via its SHCICP into a CICP, data relevant to the facility such as weather conditions, data relevant to the individual players from other databases, as well as data from other teams with similar CCT systems installed.</p>
<p id="p-0470" num="0469">Real time contextual data is thereby collected. Past performance can be matched with today's performance by each individual player and or the team as a whole. Real time input can be created such as changing a line-up, positions of the players, the actual play called to the quarter back and the ways the front line stands. All of these variations will be recorded by the CCT CICP and the master CICP. Real time results of the variations can be showcased on devices that are connected to the CCT CICP and or the master CICP.</p>
<p id="p-0471" num="0470">While some of the aspects described herein within these individual sensor chip parts are not new, the combination(s) of these hubs—individually or together functioning as a system as a part of a complete SHCICP system is/are new.</p>
<p id="p-0472" num="0471">This data gathering system can be used in other sports, whether they are performed by one person competing alone, or teams, or numerous individuals against each other or together. It can be used where the person is using equipment or not. In cases where the person is using equipment or other animals, these can also be equipped with sensors that have SHCICP architecture and communications hubs. This can range from devices such as skis, rackets, clubs, mallets, or bicycles, cars, motor cycles, sailboats, row boats or motor boats, skateboards or surf boards. They can be placed on equipment the user is earing such as protective padding, gloves, helmets, cleats, shoes or uniforms. They can be placed on training equipment, on goal posts, or barricades, walls, nets. They can be placed across a field, stadium, and track, course, under water or above. They can measure weather conditions or ambient noise, wind, smell, rain, moisture.</p>
<p id="p-0473" num="0472">Select hubs can also display the results of these calculations, the actions gathered, and the results achieved. These are devices are connected to a multi-tenant SHCICP (MT-SHCICP) system which grants access to the various information relevant to that specific user. This could be a head coach for a NFL team, the medical doctor, the head of performance data, the defensive coordinator, the coach for the quarterback etc. Each person/team has a set of data points they want to focus on. The MT-SHCICP will collect all the data and present the relevant data to the relevant user on the right device. These devices can be mobile phones, tablets, computers, virtual reality devices or other wearables.</p>
<p id="p-0474" num="0473">The data recorded and retained can be used to replay actions or event at a later time. This can be used to observe actions and see the results from these actions. The data can be used to render replay modes in video, in data stats, in augmented reality renderings, using 3D avatars of the participants or their equipment, 3D renderings of the physical space, or real life 3D video rendering depending on the data capture process. The replay of the event can be performed on site, real time or off site later. 3D environment and data gathering can be replayed in virtual reality. In all these embodiments, the MT-SHCICP has captured the data and telemetry, recorded it and retained it. It is being used to re-create the event via devices that are connected and communicating with the MT-SHCICP.</p>
<p id="p-0475" num="0474">This ability to capture real time data, performance and activity in physical areas, combine this with the activity of a user, record and retain this into the MT-SHCICP with a profile can enable experiences for the user when that user at a later time is on-line. The profile can be used to recommend content and as input to programmatic ad buying and presentation of these ads. The actions take based on these ad placements can then drive interactions in the real-world at a later stage where the MT-SHCICP can present offers or advice on behavior directly on connected devices the user has or on devices that are in the user's context. Numerous services can assist in the presentation of such content such as Unicast.</p>
<p id="p-0476" num="0475">Others can provide services that can provide an artificial intelligence recommendation engine to present the content and offers most likely to be of value to the user such as Xcense.</p>
<p id="p-0477" num="0476">The MT-SHCICP captures past behavior, records and records this and can then integrate past behavior knowledge with recommendation engines within the MT-SCHICP and the learned understanding of the current context calculated by the MT-SHCICP to deliver the right message, information or replay the right experience via devices connected to the MT-SCHICP</p>
<p id="p-0478" num="0477">Asset Location Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0479" num="0478">Alternate embodiments of the MTCICP may be configured to include a centralized system that functions to identify the location of devices, products and assets within a physical space through use of listening devices, active transmitters, mobile devices and network-connected equipment, including connections through use of, for example, relatively low cost proximity beacons, NFC tags and/or other sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0480" num="0479">Another continuation of part of the original CICP is where the connected sensors and infrastructure of a facility that has a CICP enabled infrastructure is used to communicate and locate devices and equipment as well as used to direct attention, dispatch personnel to a location and use the system to direct the closet personnel to a moveable piece of equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0481" num="0480">Such a location can be a hospital. The hospital has installed a CICP system to communicate with its patients, enabling the hospital to communicate with their patients when they are at the premises, before and after, pre-care and post-operation—via mobile devices that are connected to CICP that they wear or carry with them as they move across the hospital setting. Nurses, administrators, staff, cleaning staff and physicians also carry mobile devices that are also connected to the CICP. These devices function as input units as well as displaying content that is relevant to the individual staff member and relevant to the location they are in, their context or those nearby in proximity. The CICP can also be connected with equipment and digital signage and screens throughout the facility outside the entry, in the lobby, by elevators, outside and inside examination rooms, inside and outside operation rooms, inside and outside recovery rooms and patient rooms, inside and outside nurse stations, inside and outside waiting rooms, inside and outside physician's offices, in hallways, in stairwells, outside, inside and throughout cafeteria, outside, inside, and throughout pharmacy, outside, inside and throughout waiting rooms, outside, inside and throughout gift shops, in operations, in restrooms—throughout the facility wherever a digital sign can provide value. Sensors such as proximity beacons, NFC tags and other sensors can be placed at known locations across each of the same locations. Multiple sensors can be placed in larger areas. Some sensors can be powered by batteries, solar panels or attached to power supply. This power supply can be electrical outlets or USB ports in PCs, TVs or digital displays. These sensors and the displays are connected to the CICP and their unit and location is known by the CICP. Other sensors and proximity beacons will be placed throughout the facilities. These can be low cost Bluetooth low energy proximity beacons. None of these require connectivity or WiFi. The location of all these are known. These locations can be displayed on a digital map presented by the CICP in dashboard accessible via cloud based computers for those that have been granted access. When a person with a mobile device that is connected with the CICP comes into connection with one of these sensors or beacons, then this connected device alerts the CICP that the proximity or connection with that specific device has been established. The CICP can then detect the proximity of that user in relation to this specific sensor. To determine more exact location, triangulation between 3 node points with known location can be achieved using any standard triangulation methods or out of the box indoor navigation solution. The sensors are not connected to the CICP, the connection to the CICP occur via the mobile device the person is wearing. Numerous persons can thereby be displayed on the CICP without the need for connectivity beyond network and/or Wi-Fi that connects the devices. In addition to this system, a movable piece of equipment can be fitted with a proximity beacon. This can be a battery powered beacon or one that is connected to a power supply within the piece of equipment or on a rechargeable battery pack. This beacon's id number is logged into the CICP and assigned with that particular piece of equipment such as a hospital bed. This hospital bed is located in room <b>1</b>A. A staff member enters room <b>1</b>A and the CICP records the time and location of the entry of the staff member into room <b>1</b>A and retains this information. The staff member walks to the bed and starts moving the rollable bed. The proximity beacon on the bed triggers a proximity alert on the staff member's connected device. This connection is transmitted to the CICP which records the interaction, the time and the location of the staff member in room <b>1</b>A. Staff member moves the bed into the hall way and to the elevators. Proximity beacons along the way records the entry and exit of their range with the staff member's mobile device, which is sending this information to the CICP. At each interaction, the bed is still in proximity to the staff member's mobile device and this proximity is also noted. The staff member enters the elevator and connectivity to his device is lost while in the elevator. The CICP records and retains this lost connection as a last known location. The staff member exits the elevator on the second floor. His device connects with the proximity beacon at the 2<sup>nd </sup>floor elevator lobby, and this connection is recorded and transmitted to the CICP. Location of the staff member is thereby re-established. He is still in proximity to the bed. The beacon on the bed is also in range with the staff member's connected device. This device then communicates the location of the bed to be the same as the staff member. The staff member walks down the corridor and the same procedure as on floor <b>1</b> repeats with the mobile device alerting the CICP as it comes in and out of range of the beacons in the corridor. Real time location of the staff member is thereby captured. Each time, the proximity of the staff member's mobile device and the bed is detected, captured and transmitted to the CICP. The location of the bed is thereby also inferred. The staff member arrives at room <b>2</b>B and enters. The beacon in Room <b>2</b>B interacts with his mobile device and transmits to the CICP, the location of the staff member in room <b>2</b>B is thereby detected. The proximity of the bed to the staff member is also detected and transmitted to the CICP. The location of the bed in room <b>2</b>B can thereby be determined, recorded and retained. The staff member now leaves the bed in room <b>2</b>B and moves into the corridor. His mobile device connects with the signals from the proximity beacons in the hallway and transmits these interactions with the CICP. At this state he is not in proximity to the bed any longer. The past proximity with the bed beacon is broken and it is recorded as an “exit” between the beacon on the bed and the staff member's device, and this is also included as information sent by the device to the CICP. The location where the last proximity was detected between the bed beacon and the staff member's mobile device will be noted in the CIPC as the “last known location” and retained by the CICP as the most likely location of the bed.</p>
<p id="p-0482" num="0481">The CICP can then display this last know location on dashboard on displays connected to it to those authorized to view this information. It can then provide information and directions to this last known location directly onto mobile devices of other staff members. This can be provided via active search, or directional instructions, or alphanumerical displays of the location of each asset that has an identifying tag. Displays placed in sections of the hospital can provide lists of the assets that are close to it or on the same floor—with directions to them. This information is provided by the CICP. When a staff member stands in front of the display, this proximity is detected by the CICP and the location and information can be transmitted to the staff member's device that is connected to the CICP.</p>
<p id="p-0483" num="0482">The last known location can also be verified by the CICP. When another staff member with a device that is connected to the CIPC enters the <b>2</b>B room, the beacon on the bed will be discovered by the device. The device has connected with the CICP and the sensors in the room <b>2</b>B thereby alerting the CICP to its presence in room <b>2</b>B. When the device detects the proximity of the bed beacon, this detection is transmitted to the CICP, recorded and retained by it. The location of this proximity detection is verified to be room <b>2</b>B and the location of the bed is therefore verified and status of the bed location is “known” and in proximity to the identified staff member. When this staff member leaves the room without the bed, the last know location is recorded. When another member enters the room with another device the process is repeated. When that member leaves the room with the bed, the process from the first staff member leaving room la is repeated. The location of the asset—the bed—is therefore active and real-time when in proximity and being actively moved by a staff member, when it is stationary the last known location is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0484" num="0483">This methodology can be used to measure traffic patterns and locate assets and staff in a hospitals, factory, venue, hotel, convention center, across a port or airport, in a sports event, during a sporting event, across a stadium or anywhere there is the capability to place sensors in the physical environment, where assets, products, equipment, people, animals or other movable things can move across the physical location.</p>
<p id="p-0485" num="0484">It can also be extended beyond a physical building and extend into a larger area such as a university campus, port area or entire cities, islands or countries. Combined with a MTCICP and SHCICP the complete interactions between the physical and the people, assets, things and communication devices across a geographical area can be detected, monitored, influenced, recorded and retained, i.e., contextually intelligent city management.</p>
<p id="p-0486" num="0485">Although specific embodiments of the disclosure have been described, various modifications, alterations, alternative constructions, and equivalents are also encompassed within the scope of invention as set forth in the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0487" num="0486">The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. It will, however, be evident that additions, subtractions, deletions, and other modifications and changes may be made thereunto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of invention as set forth in the claims.</p>

The master control user can then further distribute or provide specific levels of control within the specific MTCICP, also by conventional means, so that the licensed enterprise itself will operate the specific enterprise platform in a manner that will generate commerce or some other activity. Preferably, the master control user/licensee will be responsible for all operations of the specific MTCICP, such as, for example, sales and distribution for a manufacturing or retail business; patient care and communication for a health provider enterprise; access to and communication with governmental units for a governmental application; and providing education, instruction and training at virtually all levels and types of learning activities for an educational enterprise. The capability of the application or system to provide the master control user/licensee control with access to and use of each of, and groups of multiple layers, multiple controls at each sub-level and/or multiple types of control of the platform is an advantageous feature of the present system because it provides the capability of ensuring that the correct or right message(s) are sent to the correct or right person(s) or user(s) at the correct or right time and to/from the correct or right place(s).</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

The exemplary system illustrated in </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;figref<span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">idref</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">DRAWINGS</span>"</span>&gt;</span><span>FIG. 2</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/figref&gt;</span></div><span> is a system that is an extension of the </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;figref<span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">idref</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">DRAWINGS</span>"</span>&gt;</span><span>FIG. 1</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/figref&gt;</span></div><span> system, and is a system in which the areas of influence are preferably controlled by respective sub-users who are positioned at the various layers or levels of the overall architecture, although defining and designating areas of influence may be tasks assigned to some other system user, such as for example, the master control user. In another aspect of the nature of the areas of influence or definition or designation of areas of influence, an area of influence can be designated or defined, for example, as a geographical area, a subset of clients that designated sub-control users have access to, some grouping of users for which access is time-limited, or for which access is granted on some other predefined criterion or criteria. Thus, the system is adapted to provide for one or more areas of influence that can be defined by multiple criteria, such as a geographical area and specification of characteristics of a user or groups of users, interests of a user or group(s) of users, specific position of the user(s) in the larger geographical area, identity of any device(s) to which the end user has access, any device(s) associated with the end user and so forth. With respect to the system embodiments illustrated in </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;figref<span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">idref</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">DRAWINGS</span>"</span>&gt;</span><span>FIG. 1</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/figref&gt;</span></div><span> and </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;figref<span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">idref</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">DRAWINGS</span>"</span>&gt;</span><span>FIG. 2</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/figref&gt;</span></div><span>, controls of and for the various levels and controls of and within each level and sub-level are shown. Preferably, specific assignment or designation of a specific degree or type of control and/or access is based on the nature of an area's influence at each of the various layers of system administration, respectively. Preferably, the master control and/or master control user has the capability to assign to one or more of the sub-levels of control, and the capability to set further controls at each level and sub-level. As one example, consider a convention center, such as the San Diego Convention Center, to be the master control and having a master control user. The Convention Center could lease designated Convention Center assets, and lease control of the system's sub-level 1 to a sub-level 1 control user, who could be a convention manager for a specific convention at the Convention Center or the convention sponsor of a specific convention at the Convention Center. The sub-level 1 user would then have access to the leased facilities and leased system during a specific time, such as when that specific convention is open in San Diego. The sub-level 1 control user would then have, for example, access to certain or predesignated sections of the Convention Center during certain or predesignated periods. More specifically, consider the well-known Comic-Con convention in which the convention manager or organization that hosts the convention then leases or sub-leases space in the convention center to exhibitors and content owners during that time. The number and types of levels and controls is variable, and can be changed over time. For example, in the case of Comic-Con, the entire Convention Center might be leased for control by the sponsor. For other conventions, perhaps taking place at the same or overlapping times, such as the American Cancer Society convention and the American Heart Association convention, only part of the Convention Center and part of the Convention Center assets would be leased to each organization, and each organization would have sub-level 1, “geo-control” over only the part of the Convention Center that it leased.</span></div><span class="folded hidden">...</span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div></div><span>

Marvel might want the capability of having a proximity event trigger within its booth, and of having rights to influence only people within a certain distance from its booth. Also, exhibitor Marvel might want to have access to beacons or systems that are outside of the convention center, but included in the offerings by the Convention Center that are available to exhibitors. The system has the capability to provide for this level and type of access, and it could also be included in the lease. The ability or capability for the system to physically locate an end user inside or outside of the convention center is also included within the presently described system though use of various wireless devices. The system includes and uses a combination of proximity sensors, proximity beacons (or “i beacons”), near field communication tags (“NFC”) and augmented reality triggers, for example, images that are located only within the booth. As used in the present system, proximity beacons, such as “iBeacons™” brand proximity beacons are conventional devices that are relatively small and transmit low power, BlueTooth signals for a specific range. Each preferably has an identifier that is assigned to it and is controlled by one more users of the present system for a specific use or specific application such as the San Diego Convention Center Comic-Con convention. The conventional proximity beacon signaling is received by a sensor, and the signals are then transmitted through the various levels of control in the present system, in accordance with access and control assigned to the device and the users as described herein. When an authorized end user is within the predetermined proximity of the device, the device's signal is transmitted to and received by the end user. Such proximity beacons are available from several sources, such as Kontak.io, Gimbal and Estimote. Gimbal brand proximity beacons are preferred, specifically its Series S10, Series S20 and U-Series 5, although any conventional proximity beacon device may be used, so long as it performs its signaling functions as required by the system described herein.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

Within area of influence C, a specific retail store could further designate areas of influence according to products, services or profit centers, such as “toys”, “women's clothing”, “sporting goods”, “restaurant”, etc.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

In another application, for instance, in an airport use example, if an executive is walking the facilities and sees a problem with one of the flight information displays (“FID”s) that digitally display flight information at gates or other locations at the airport, that executive could send an alert that there is a problem in FID No. </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>5</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, for example, and the system will recognize where that location is, will recognize that the input is from an authorized member of the management team and is a request for service, will recognize who sent the alert and will determine the level or type of user who should receive this message.

For example, a CEO preferably will have the maximum or ultimate control or ability to send messages to any of the users, but a janitorial staff supervisor could have a relatively limited ability regarding the types of messages that could be sent and where the messages could be sent. For example, a janitorial or maintenance supervisor in the management team </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>298</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> would be blocked from sending messages that would change information on any of the FIDs for airlines using the airport. With respect to a convention center example, the various types of users in the executive group would have control, access and functionality from the organizational and operational standpoint of the facility. A designated supervisor could have overall control across the janitorial services and security services as well as the IT aspects of those parts of the system. With a system having multiple layers of supervisors, each supervisor preferably would have an area of influence that corresponds to that supervisor's actual responsibility. For example, the janitorial supervisor in charge of a specific section, such as “Section B” of a convention center, could have and use the same input mechanism, as described in the above example to identify an issue or a problem that that need to be addressed or that some other action needs to take place in Section B of the convention center. At the same time, while an upper management user, for example, the CEO, who may be touring the facilities and sees that there is another issue or problem, or the same issue or problem, and can send the same message or command as sent by the janitorial supervisor. However, the message or command from the CEO could go global to all users in the system, in comparison to the message or command send by the Section B janitorial supervisor, which message or command preferably would be sent only to the Section B janitorial staff.</span></div><span class="folded hidden">...</span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div></div><span>

Suppose there is a coffee spill at that location and the spill is noticed by a convention center management team user, specifically a maintenance supervisor of that section in the convention center. That supervisor's alert of the coffee spill is transmitted into the system at arrow </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>298</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>A, and the system </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>294</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> then as shown by arrow </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>300</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> alerts the maintenance staff and the service staff of the workforce </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>302</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> that is in control of that specific location.

Continuing with this example of a coffee spill, and the other users identified by arrow </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>304</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, for example, the system </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>294</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> would send a message to the tenant who sells coffee in that section. That tenant would not be responsible for cleaning up the spill, but would want to know about it and be assured that the spill was being cleaned up by the convention center staff, and the message to the tenant would provide that information and assurance. In this example, the system alerts the tenant of that section that a facility manager has identified the spill and the cleaning staff has been assigned to clean up the coffee spill.</span></div><span class="folded hidden">...</span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div></div><span>

Those two sensors are adapted to communicate with a sensor hub, which in this instance a sensor hub can be the program that resides on, for example, a Samsung Gear S2 brand watch. The watch would be adapted to include a component of the CICP that combines the sensory input from each of these two sensors before it transmits the information to the MTCICP </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>296</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>.

In other words, two or more sensors in communication with a single Sensor Hub and/or a single SHCICP need not be totally independent of each other, but rather the information output from one sensor could depend, in some way, on data that comes in from another sensor or other sensors. A Sensor Hub could be simply a hub that combines the data, and only collects and transmits data forward to a SHCICP. Sensor Hub CICPs, such as at </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>384</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>396</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> and </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>406</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> preferably have algorithms that function to combine data and to define an output that goes into MTCICP </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>296</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>. A specific system embodiment can be adapted to include sensor to sensor communication, sensor to sensor hub communication, and multiple sensors to a common sensor hub communication or multiple sensor hub communications to a common sensor hub in order to be transmitted through the system and into the platform. The sensor hub could be merely a pass-through, much like a switch, or, alternatively, it could also include some processing capability, but preferably the main processing capability will be in the SHCICP where the data is aggregated. The system can be adapted so that aggregation would be in a mobile device, in a series of mobile devices, in a field-based computer system, and/or in a call-by system, for example.

In this example each player, during a training session at a training facility, is fitted with sensors on his shoes, ankles, wrists and/or in his helmet. Each sensor has a relatively low power transmitter and has the capability to define or generate data representative of the mobility of each body part, the rate of speed and the acceleration of each body part during play. These data are then combined or aggregated via an algorithm to create a full picture of the activity, that is, data representative of the motions and actions of the player. The sensors are preferably of low enough power, low enough transmission range and sufficiently lightweight to not adversely interfere with the activities of the player, but have enough power and transmission range to generate data useful for the intended purpose of the invention. For example, a hub could be a Samsung Gear brand watch or a watch-like device that is worn on the wrist or elsewhere on a user's body. The hub functions to collect the data from the sensors and to transmit the data to the server as described, for example, with reference to </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;figref<span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">idref</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">DRAWINGS</span>"</span>&gt;</span><span>FIG. 14</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/figref&gt;</span></div><span>. Continuing with the football player example, another sensor attached to the player could generate data that would correspond to or measure blood pressure or pulse rate of the player, in real time during play. Also, the sensor set could include a motion sensor, or a moisture monitor to determine the sweating level of the player. The hubs and SHCICPs could combine all these data to create a composite picture or data set for each player on the team and that would be representative of the player's condition. As another example, one or more accelerometers could be placed on a player's helmet and would be adapted to provide data representative of or directly proportional to the force of a hit during play, and that might provide other information, such as likelihood of a concussion resulting from the hit.</span></div><span class="folded hidden">...</span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div></div><span>

The museum has an MTCICP system </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>416</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> in place, and has a content that is curated around specific exhibits. A person end user, who is a visitor to this museum, can experience that context as the user enters into the museum, and near the exhibit. The MTCICP system </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>412</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> can control delivery of the content by location of the user, by whom the content is delivered, what content is delivered to whom, how and when. The experiences that are being presented are curated in such a fashion that they have been prepared and approved by a control-user, such as a museum board of directors. The methodology of the delivery of the content can vary such as vary based on location. Delivery doesn't have to be only on the premises of the museum for instance. Now the content, the curated content </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>414</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, can be delivered on the mobile device of the user(s) when they are at a specific location or area, for example, the ruins of Pompeii or at some other site of historical significance.

Also in order to make sure that the right product is sold, management needs to have control of what's in stock, the inventory levels, what's likely to sell out now and what would be appropriate incentives to sell designated products. Examples of business insight could include trends, such as the weakening dollar versus yen, and should a certain type of product be pushed on a specific day, status of future delivery of orders of merchandise, staffing requirements or staffing issues, forecasts of an upcoming snowstorm or a hurricane. In the present example, trends and projections are intended to be forward looking as where the business wants to go, rather than known information and predictions on what is actually going to happen and what is happening within specific areas. Sales tools could refer to, for example, information such as the best words in order to sell a particular product or special features of a product in comparison to a competitor's product.</span></div><span class="folded hidden">...</span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div></div><span>

The system's MTCICP </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>522</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> will record and retain all interactions within the system to ensure, verify and monitor compliance.</span></div><span class="folded hidden">...</span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div></div><span>

An office administrator would have access to the system via a tablet or dashboard, shown at </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>532</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>. The administrator user(s) would be somebody who has more control of scheduling and has access to a dashboard that is potentially in a computer in the office. A discharge administrator, shown at </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>534</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, is also somebody who has control of the platform via dashboards.

The MTCICP alerts the patient when it is time to take medication. The patient acknowledges receipt of the message and will say “yes, I'll take the medication”, thereby providing a medication compliance trigger back into the MTCICP, as shown at arrow </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>542</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>.

Here there is a need for the physician </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>506</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> to provide information </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>554</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> to the patient and with a need for a response </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>556</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>. In this example, medical information about a procedure is provided from the physician at </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>554</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> through the MTCICP. The information is delivered to the patient either via the wearable device or the patient discharge tablet at </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>558</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>. The response is at </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>560</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, which is then put into the curated content </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>552</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> in case a complication has occurred. The system then can automatically identify whether there is a problem and if so communicates a message to all of the caregivers that are associated with the patient, namely the staff, the physician and the nurse, as shown at </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>556</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>566</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>566</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, respectively.

In this example an alert </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>570</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> is delivered as shown at </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>572</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> to a patient who has been notified to take medication and the alert is confirmed at </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>574</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>.

This is the same basic system as in </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;figref<span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">idref</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">DRAWINGS</span>"</span>&gt;</span><span>FIG. 24</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/figref&gt;</span></div><span> that provides for delivery of curated content to the patient, but includes two additional levels of influence for the patient. One level could be friend(s) or close family member(s) </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>600</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, and the alert system can alert that person/those persons that there might be a problem as shown at </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>602</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>. As shown at </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>604</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, that person is now alerted about the patient and asked to verify that everything is well. If that action has not happened or the family member cannot go to the patient, then the system could alert a user in a second group, such as a neighbor, volunteer, etc., as shown at </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>612</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>. Whoever acknowledges that they can respond, will get more detailed information, and then contact the patient at </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>614</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>. Regardless of who is contacted, the communications are recorded and reported into the system at </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>616</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>.</span></div><span class="folded hidden">...</span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div></div><span>

In such instances, sensors in the facility can also communicate with the MTCICP and provide useful input data or information. The information can, for example range from audio, temperature, movement, noise, moisture, smoke or other conditions that the sensor(s) detect, record and/or transmit. The process of alert and alarm communication through the MTCICP will be routed to the correct MTCICP connected device. For example, a connected smoke alarm, when activated would cause the application to route the alarm to the Master Control and to the nearest fire station.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>
</span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;p<span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">id</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">p-0219</span>"</span><span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">num</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">0218</span>"</span>&gt;</span><span>As another example, connected sensors and the MTCICP could also be used to verify that a staff member has performed a given task. Such a task could be to open a refrigerated cooler or vending machine that is used to display and present cold drinks for sale or that dispenses cold drinks, respectively. The cooler or vending machine would have a proximity beacon. The enterprise specific application would provide information about the location of the cooler, by, for example a map showing the location of the device. As the staff member approaches the cooler, the proximity beacon will trigger an event on the staff member's device. This event is transmitted to the MTCICP server, recorded and retained as when the staff approached the cooler. The beacon inside will also transmit the temperature around it and its battery life. Both are transmitted to the connected device which then transmits this to the MTCICP. This is also recorded and retained by the MTCICP. Once the cooler door is opened, the temperature will drop. This is observed by the beacon sensor and transmitted to the staff member's connected device that then sends this to the MTCICP. This event is recorded and retained. The process is repeated when the staff member closes the door, and moves away from the cooler. Each event is recorded and retained by the MTCICP. Access can be granted to the MTCICP to the staff member's boss, his supervisor and the owner of the organization that services the coolers. The owner of the facility where the cooler or vending machine is placed can also be granted access to the MTCICP to review the collected and recorded data. The producer of the drinks that are sold or dispensed can also be granted access to the MTCICP to review the collected and recorded data. The same MTCICP has thereby been used to direct staff member to perform an action, verified that it has been performed, verified that the staff members was at the location, recorded when the staff member arrived, recorded how long he was there, and recorded when he left. The same system then can grant the ability to verify these events by the staff member's boss, the owner of the cooler and the owner of the location—all different entities and organizations.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>
</span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;p<span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">id</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">p-0220</span>"</span><span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">num</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">0219</span>"</span>&gt;</span><span>The MTCICP can also be used to control the actual functions and functionality of the building. It can be connected to Smart Building infrastructures and sensors, equipment, control systems and infrastructure. This can include switches, controls and sensors, door locks, access cards, elevators, escalators, fire suppression, HVAC, AC, heating, lights, power supplies, window shades and other aspects of the building controls. These sensors can be connected directly to the MTCICP or via sensor hubs that can communicate the aggregated results from a series of such sensors. Those sensors that can control functions will have 2-way communications so that they can receive commands and actions from the MTCICP based on the actions it determines, and that are based on the events for which it collects data. These events can be collected from a sensor or from a series of sensors in the facility, or from people or equipment that is in the building temporarily. The people will have mobile devices that have installed software or operating systems that are also connected to the MTCICP. They can have full access to the MTCICP system or have been granted access, for example, to only a select series of interactions, sensors or events, for a predetermined time or for always as long as their log in credentials are accredited. In this way the MTCICP system's multi-tenant architecture is used as a partition system that functions to grant access and deliver content to the right person at the right time, even within a building, venue or structure for those who work there, operate it, maintain it, provide safety and or services to the building and to those who work there, visit, stay or live there.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

Those events that warrant an action will trigger actions to be transmitted to the right sensor or control unit or display or device or equipment.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>
</span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;p<span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">id</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">p-0222</span>"</span><span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">num</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">0221</span>"</span>&gt;</span><span>This will enable the MTCICP to detect, e.g., how many people are in specific areas, determine the temperature in the area through devices such as NEST or Samsung Smart Works sensors, account for how many people are on the escalator coming to that room, start cooling the area via the control units on the NEST thermostat's control unit before the people enter because it is more efficient to cool the room than after they have arrived Likewise, light controls can be connected to turn on while there are people there, and off when they leave, creating “following lights” down corridors for instance. Elevators, moving sidewalks and escalators may also be connected in this manner providing low power speeds or remain stationary while there are no people close by or on the devices. The levels of controls can be set and controlled by the MTCICP. For instance, digital displays along the moving walkways can be programmed to present content and offers to the people on the moving walkway as they pass by.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

These data will provide a deep level of records for the way a person interacts with his or her surroundings—real life physical interactions. These data are contextually anchored, by time, person, ID, the type of interactions, the location, the type of location, what content was presented, what content was consumed, what content was interacted upon, what products, equipment, sensors, displays, cars, sports equipment, buildings were interacted with, used, consumed, viewed. All data can be made anonymous should this be required by rules and regulation. All data can be retained and/or removed. All data can be used again. This way the system is looking at past behavior to determine what is likely to be of interest for a person “next” based on their past behavior and current context. This context match does not need to be based on the users past behavior. It can be leveraging what others in the same context, with the same or similar background profiles have found of interest. By blending all these components, the MTCICP will create its intelligence. The content that is being presented does not need to be sent back to the originating device. Such an example can be a sports fan that is a fan of the Ole Miss Football team. He has downloaded the Rebel rewards app which is connected to a MTCICP operated by the Ole Miss Athletics Department. He is at the game when a record is set and one of the team members is a guaranteed shoe-in for the Heisman trophy. The system recognizes that he was in the stands the moment this happened. Two weeks later, he is on-line at home on his tablet. A sports fan site has signed a deal with Ole Miss to produce baseball caps commemorating the event, and also signed a deal to access the MTCICP. The off-line experience of being at the stadium that moment triggered an event in the MTCICP that is recorded and retained. When he is back on-line the access is recognized and an action is sent. This action is to present a personalized offer to get the baseball cap personalized and shipped to his home address—all information is pre-programmed and included in the offer—so it's an on-click order to have a personalized baseball cap shipped and paid for—memorizing his time in the stand. Once he is back in the stadium, the system will recognize he is back, and offer him, e.g., a special Coke, Hot-dog and Fries for $5 since he was there at the magic moment and had purchased the hat. Coke had also access to the MTCICP and the past actions with the current context caused the offer that was made on-line to be extended off-line into the real world. The MTCICP can also be used in situations when the access to the platform is widely granted due to a specific event. Such can be a natural disaster such as an avalanche at a ski resort. The resort operator would have a MTCICP enabled system where beacons or devices are used by the skiers as a guidance and access tool. Proximity solutions can grant access to lifts; provide VIP access to restaurants and record number of runs the skier has skied down. In platform tracking can be used to record number of runs, vertical drop skied, speed and g-forces. In the event an avalanche occurs the system can be reversed and access to detect proximity between users—the skiers—can be granted to all. Should someone be buried in snow, that skier's device will continue to transmit “I am here” signals. In this instance, instead of fixed sensors in the facilities, every other skier with the system can receive an alert about the proximity of another skier. Should a skier be buried in snow, the skiers above will be alerted to those other skiers above and visible by eye-sight, will also be alerted to the proximity of those skiers who are out of sight—i.e., buried in the snow. Signal strength can be used to guide rescuers to the person buried as weakening signal indicates moving away, stronger means getting closer. While this is not 100% accurate, it will minimize the time needed to start digging and getting oxygen to those under snow. In this instance, the multi-tenant architecture has been used to turn a crowd into the authorized user of the system, enabling rescue efforts to be crowd-sourced before official and professional help arrives.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

Real time interactions with products, locations, sensors, printed materials and other contextual experiences will be gathered by the MTCICP as often as the system is programmed to gather the information. As this data is collected, it is combined with the information about the user that the user has given permission to collect. This data is gathered into a profile for the user. This profile can remain assigned to that specific person, or can be made anonymous and related to a specific user device and/or other way to anonymously identify that profile with past and future behavior as described herein. The MTCICP can be used by a third party who has been granted access to this system to present offers, content and experiences when that person at a later time interacts with this party's MTCICP or other communication systems. This system can be a re-targeting ad server, and artificial intelligent recommendation engine or other communication platform. The content delivered, and the action the user has taken upon the delivery of said content can then be used to further improve and expand the profile retained within the first MTCICP system.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

One such embodiment is in a museum setting. The operator of the museum can install a MTCICP system. They can then assign personnel internally to curate content relevant to the artifacts they show. They can enable content and content descriptions relevant to their artifacts to be provided by 3rd parties and or common databases. The MTCICP will enable the right curated content to be delivered to the right person on the right device. Such devices can be the museum visitor's own devices that have MTCICP enabled applications installed, with the devices including those such as mobile phones and wearables, or devices that are lent or leased by the museum and remain their property, those that are leased by the MTCICP provider to the museum or devices that are fixed at the museum. These devices can also be tablets, phones, wearables, digital displays, AR devices, VR devices, connected rooms, and other future display systems such as HoloLens, Samsung GearVR or other VR display technologies. The curated content can be delivered by the museum operator via the MTCICP on-site inside the museum, outside on the museum property or off-site such as remote sites or historic sites, or cities or ruins beyond the physical boundaries of the museum. Should there be an entity that owns this location or has other interests in such a location, they can be granted access to control the curated experiences that are triggered on such a site via the administrated access to the designated feature set of the MTCICP.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

The objective of this can be to enhance the experiences to those that are there, it can be to provide information, it can be to provide services, and it can be to provide safety and security. The same infrastructure of the MTCICP will enable all to access the same infrastructure, but to provide content and experiences that are within their domain or expertise or mandate. In such instances it can be used to promote a brand to a sports fan, while providing crowd control and security oversight to campus police, while granting access to concessionaires that want to sell products to the fans while in stadium. The same system can be used to provide educational content to students while in class rooms, enable automatic rollcall for attendance to university administrators while enabling educators in the room to push educational content at one time that is delivered personalized to the individual student in the designated room—or any other designated location. This system can also be used by students and teachers as a tool to learn how to deliver content, test what works and what does not, what inspired and drives activity and changes behavior, and what does not. In such an embodiment, the end users that experience these interactions can be limited to those who have granted the MTCICP permission to present such test cases, not the general public who have been granted permission only to final and commercial content.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

One such embodiment is the ability to display an indication of number of users at each entry gate at a sports facility that has an MTCICP system installed with end user devices that are connected. Based on the interactions the system has at each enabled location, and the dwell time each such interaction has, the MTCICP can detect the density of users and the time that they are expected to remain in this area. An approximation of wait time and density of people can thereby be deduced. The MTCICP can present this information on the end user's devices so that the end user can make a choice of which entry to use. In addition, the MTCICP can send messages to those people who are in a line at a crowded entry point and informed that there is a smaller crowds and/or a shorter anticipated wait time at another entry point. Likewise, the anticipated wait time can be displayed on interactive displays / signs that can provide those users that are there with an anticipated wait time. This can be extended and further enhanced in areas of long lines such as amusement parks or taxi lines at busy airports. Here numerous displays/signs with sensors can be placed with known and fixed distances between each. As a member with a MTCICP connected device comes into proximity to sign number 1, the MTCICP records the time. When he moves along and comes into proximity to sign/display number 2 that is a known distance apart from sign number 1, simple calculation can be made to determine the rate of speed. This process can be repeated along the line and once a slowdown is determined, the time for a person who enters the line at sign </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>1</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> to arrive at the final destination which is a distance known distance can be calculated by the MTCICP and displayed at the sign </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>1</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> and on the user's MTCICP connected device.</span></div><span class="folded hidden">...</span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div></div><span>

Once such presence has been detected, the MTCICP can send alerts to others about the presence of the user in such an environment. This can be of great use to a hotel operator. As their guest arrives on the premises with a device that is connected to the hotel's MTCICP system, the MTCICP can send multiple messages alerting hotel staff about the guest's presence. This can be the car valet service and the bellboy services. They can be alerted by the MTCICP with details about the user such as name of the user, his status with the hotel rewards system to determine VIP level, his preferences and past visits thereby enabling the staff to present a personalized welcome. Should the hotel's MTCICP also be connected to the hotel's booking system, an automatic check-in can happen when sensors inside the lobby detect the presence of the user via his MTCICP connected devices. Should a payment be needed this payment can be tendered within the MTCICP if it has been so programmed. The payment tender can be closed via any of the current and future payment methodologies that have been incorporated into the MTCICP such as Samsung's PAY, Apple PAY, Google PAY, and Passport. Should the hotel MTCICP have been programmed to interact and be integrated with the hotel's room management and room key and room lock system, a token, message, programming code, other encrypted key granting access to the hotel room that the user has paid for can be delivered to the user's MTCICP connected device such as a mobile phone, wearable device such as a smart watch or other programmable device connected to the MTCICP. As the user arrives by his room, his connected device will grant him access via the MTCICP connected device to the room for the period that he has paid for via the MTCICP integrated room lock. As he enters the room with his MTCICP enabled device (s) his presence in the room is detected by sensors in the room. These can be passive sensors communicating with a room hub that communicates to the hotel MTCICP, control sensors that takes input and sends a control output command, and those that interact with both the user's MTCICP enabled devices and the hotel master MTCICP control systems. Interactions within the room can thereby controlled by input from the various sensors in the room with actions delivered to those devices they control, based on the presence of the user in the context as well as the use's past preferences as collected by the user's MTCICP connected device and / or a combination of this profile and the known past behavior and preferences of the user that the hotel MTCICP has retained and accessed and/or a third party's provided profile of the user that the hotel's MTCICP has been granted access to or any combination of any of the above. The room can therefore change its environment such as temperature, light, shades drawn or closed, radio station, tv channel based on the understanding of the user via the presence of his MTCICP enabled device in the environment that has sensors and controlled via the same connected MTCICP.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

These processes are then repeated as needed providing a real-time context aware, context intelligent CICP solutions that capture real-time data, do on cloud computations and edge computing to deliver content and experiences that “turns venues into destinations” </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>938</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, “creates loyalty” </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>942</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, “increases revenues” </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>944</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> and provides “conversions” </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>948</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> while recording, retaining and storing all relevant data, outcomes and actions in relevant databases. This approach ensures an intelligent and self-learning solution.

Big data in this instance is depicted as data across a “smart city” installation of a SHCICP-MTCICP system </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>950</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>. The data collected from every smart phone, smart city sensor and Internet of Things (IoT) devices are collected and combined to deliver real-time behavior and patterns of behavior from both the physical world and the digital/mobile world shown at </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>954</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>. This is all combined to enable revenue enhancements. These data that have been collected are transmitted as shown with dashed arrow </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>956</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> to be displayed real-time on dashboards </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>958</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> so that the data can be reviewed and used for further calculations such as inference and recommendation algorithms, with the ability to see real-time results of campaigns, messages and commands sent. This real-time display of the data is shown as </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>958</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>. This ability to see immediate results on a dashboard or combinations of dashboards, is then used by others as shown with arrow </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>960</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>. The data can be used for evaluation shown at </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>962</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>. Such evaluations can be for evaluating campaigns and A-B testing that can for instance be used to convert browsers in a shopping mall to actual buyers, can provide information to people real time to manage crowds and can enable messages, content and experiences to be delivered to drive healthy behavior such as taking the stairs in a government office rather than the elevators. Instead of the typical reporting capability of traditional big data systems that provide reports in the future of what is happening now, or provide reports now of what happened in the past, this system enables real-time viewing of real-time events as they actually unfold, the results of messages sent and the results of campaigns and A-B testing. This real-time use of data can be a tool to provide content to influence behavior. This complete process leads to “intelligent use of Big Data” </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>952</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> as shown by arrow </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>964</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>.

The SHCICP, CICP and/or MTCICP are connected to the control databases such as—but not limited to—Customer Database </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3240</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, the enterprise's own Enterprise Database </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3242</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> and a database or number of databases with information about the relevant experiences, actions, context, locations, merchandise and or event as shown as Experience Database </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3244</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>.

One advantageous aspect of this embodiment of the invention is that the SDK will be programmed to have features and complexity based on the type of distributor depicted as “Developer” </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3252</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, “Enterprise IT” </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3254</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> or “Small/Midsize Business” </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3256</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> all of which are in communication with the SDK </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3248</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> as shown by link </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3258</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>. If the distributer is a “Developer” </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3252</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, there are two ways this “Developer” can distribute the solution to its “End User” </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3260</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>: via a single “Business Customer “N” </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3262</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> with a dedicated solution distributed as shown with arrow </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3264</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> and presented to the End User </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3260</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> as shown with arrow </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3266</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>.

An SDK can also be created for an Enterprise, shown as “Enterprise IT” at </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3254</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, which receives a solution as shown with arrows </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3258</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> and </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3254</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>.

This Device </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3594</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> is programmed to identify the End User A and/or his device when in proximity, as shown with arrows </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3604</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> and </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3606</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>. This programmed identification can be via BLE, WiFi signature, and/or a series or combination of readily available peer to peer protocols that are available when authorized by End User A and enabled on police devices. Once the connection is established, the End User A Device </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3596</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> can authenticate the matching, as shown for example by a communication shown with arrow </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3606</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>.

This process can repeat until End User A and End User B arrive at acceptable transaction terms. The uniqueness of this alternate embodiment of the invention is the use of a common CICP to pair an entity/user that has something to sell or have something to offer and a user that has a desire to purchase something. This can translate to other transactions without the actual purchase of a product such as for services such as transportation where ride share and taxi services can use the same system.

This does not mean that the devices need to be in the same location. A series of additional curated education experiences have been created and stored in a database; “Experience/Motion Capture, AR/VR/MR Database” </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3972</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, which communicates with the “School SHCICP/MTCTCIP” </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3940</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> in bi-directional communication as illustrated with links </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3974</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> and </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3976</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>. This same database is also in bi-directional communication with the “Central Government MTCICP” </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3980</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> as shown with arrow </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3978</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, with the “State “N” Government MTCICP″ </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3982</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> as shown </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3984</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> and with the “Local “N” Government MTCICP/SHCICP” </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3952</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> as shown with arrow </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3988</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>. When “Student N” and the Teacher </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3936</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> are in proximity, a verification of this proximity can be detected in two manners: one is via direct proximity detection between the two devices </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3966</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3938</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, as depicted by links </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3990</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> and </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3992</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>. This proximity also can be determined via a series of known technologies such as BLE and/or other proximity/peer-to-peer technologies. A methodology to detect that the student and teacher are in the same context but not at the same location, i.e., they are not in proximity, for instance, they are in a distance learning situation with the teacher in one location and the student(s) is/are in another location is that the “School SHCICP/MTCTCIP” </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3940</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> detects that both are in the same context and makes the pairing between the student and the teacher. Once the connection is made, the “School SHCICP/MTCTCIP” </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3940</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> will alert the teacher as depicted with communication link </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3944</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>. The teacher can then use her device to communicate and control the curated content delivery from the “School SHCICP/MTCTCIP” </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3940</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, from her device as depicted with arrow </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3942</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>. The “School SHCICP/MTCTCIP” </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3940</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> will then compute the curated content to be delivered by combining the data and input from the systems connected to it as described with reference to </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;figref<span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">idref</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">DRAWINGS</span>"</span>&gt;</span><span>FIG. 117</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/figref&gt;</span></div><span>, as well as from the “Experience/Motion Capture, AR/VR/MR Database” </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3972</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, the “Teacher Database” </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3946</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> and the “Student Database” </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3958</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>, and serve this content to the student as depicted with arrow </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>3970</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>.

This exhibitor can then use the portion of the MTCICP they are granted access to.

Instead of a time restriction, they can be granted access to use only a portion of the MTCICP that accesses and interacts with attendees while they are in a predetermined area or granted access to control a specific area within the convention center where they can interact with attendees that have devices that are connected with the MTCICP. They can then offer content such as their food and drink menu to the attendees. This will be controlled by their access to the MTCICP and delivered from the MTCICP to the attendee's mobile device when the attendees are within the geographical area or specific area within the convention center. Such menu message can be programmed to launch an order system within the mobile device. The attendee can then place an order on their device. This order is sent to the MTCICP which then will transmit this order to a device in the concessionaire stand or a mobile device one of the staff members carry that is also connected to the MTCICP or to the Point of Sale system the concessionaire is using. A mobile payment for the order can also be accommodated through the same system in the same fashion. Systems such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay, MasterCard Pass or other payment systems can be incorporates into the MTCICP to handle the financial transaction portions.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

This access can be granted based on time, location or other per-determined parameters agreed upon by the master licensee of the MTCICP and the sub licensee. This access can be granted against no compensations, for compensation or for a participation of any commerce generated via the use of the MTCICP by all parties.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

Such access can be granted via access to the MTCICP. This access can then be granted for a limited time, but can work across all the geographical areas, including within the range of other sub-leases. The access can be limited to parameters in other fashions such as based on gender, age, interests, profession, position, wealth, type of car owned, level of authority, national origin for tourists and other parameters known within the MTCICP and its extended and connected databases.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

Numerous ways to leverage and select the most relevant offer to present exists and can be incorporated into the MTCICP to ensure a limited number of offers and content are presented. Reverse “Dutch” auctions can be used and pre-programmed in a manner to programmatically present the offers that are most relevant and paying most to be displayed first.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

Modern airport operators have turn into landlords, leasing space to concessionaires and earning a percentage of their sales in addition to the lease they charge for the space. Airlines lease access to gates and typically no longer own these. In most modern airports, parking is one of the top revenue generators if not top. It is therefore in the interests to have happy travelers that spend as much time as possible walking in the airport, shopping and dining/eating/drinking after they have parked their car. A happy traveler spends a lot more than one that is stressed and rushed to get to their gate. The MTCICP can enable the airport to create a series of new revenue streams. It can lease access to the system to airlines, concessionaires, stores and restaurants, to tourism agencies, amusement parks, transportation companies, hotels, convention centers and any other entity that wants to communicate with travelers. This can be the advertisers and brands that pay for display ads in the airport, it can be products that are beings sold or the owners of the companies providing services for the airport.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

Should there be a call to action in the message such as open a message, follow a link to another page or to go to a physical location, the MTCICP system will record such an action and retain it.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

This event is logged and it is determined if an action is warranted. Such actions can be a control command back to the system component that triggered, recorded and transmitted the event. If and when warranted the control command is sent to the appropriate device. This device can be the originating device, or any other connected device that has been associated with the originating device. In certain events, no action is warranted and no control commands are sent. In all instances, the event and any actions taken are verified to have been performed. The whole process is recorded and retained. The commands sent will trigger new events. These events are then matched against the desired outcome of the action. If the desired outcome was produced another event has occurred and the desired outcome has been verified. If the desired outcome was not produced, another event has occurred and the failure to achieve the desired outcome has been verified. All events and actions are recorded. What produces the desired outcomes will be repeated as needed and desired.

In such an installation, the access points can be used to triangulate the location of any device that is connected to the MTCICP. Numerous system currently exists that can provide accurate locations based on such sensors. Solutions that detect location, way-finding and solutions that enable guided navigation from one point to another point within the facility are also available. Integration of these into the MTCICP enables the various users of the MTCICP to present offers within the navigation and guides presented back to the users of the system as they progress through the facility.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

Here the retail chain has purchased a master MTCICP. They have installed a MTCICP system in each retail location. Each sub set of the MTCICP is controlled by the master MTCICP at the corporate HQ. The local store management has been granted limited access to control aspects of the system that is installed only in its physical location. Its sales staff has devices that are connected with the MTCICP. The devices that the staff carries in the store will transmit their location to the sub MTCICP. The store manager can then see the location of his staff from his device that has been granted another layer of access than the staff's devices. When a customer with a device that has a software or mobile app or otherwise has granted the retailer access to contact the customer enters the retail location, the event of this entry is recorded by the system. The MTCICP will then match this customer who has granted approval to be identified to the retailer and operator of the MTCICP with their profile that the retailer has on the customer. This profile can be a loyalty or reward program, a store credit card, a frequent buyer card, or other sources of user profiles the retailer retains on its customers. The MTCICP can also go to other connected databases to seek more information about the customer. Numerous sources for demographic data exist, as well as buying patterns from activities both on-line and off-line. This data will be aggregated by the MTCICP. The sum of this data will then be presented to the sub MTCICP system in the retail location. The location of the customer in the store will be monitored, recorded and retained. Should the customer stop at any place indicating that they have intent to understand, experience, touch, feel or try a product at that particular location within the premises; the MTCICP will detect such an action. Based on the dwell time the customer has at this location, a message can be sent from the MTCICP to a staff member or a number of staff members that are near-by. This message can be sent with back-ground information gathered by the MTCICP so that the staff member is well prepared when they initiate the verbal communication with the customer. When the staff member comes into proximity of the customer, the MTCICP system records this. Messages can be sent out to the other staff members that they do no longer need to look for the customer. Content that is relevant to the location can be presented by the MTCICP to the staff member so that the staff member can present stats or other features. The MTCICP can also send message and present content to the customer via his or her device that is connected to the MTCICP. Information such as comparisons, inventory level, options, features and functions can be presented in a sales promotional manner to the customer, while information about the product sent to the staff member has been created to assist in closing the sale. Thereby, the MTCICP is sending the right message to the right person, at the right time while they are both close to each other. All the data, the interactions, the customers dwell time at the product before the staff arrives, the time it took the staff member to arrive, the content sent to the customer and the content sent to the staff member will all be recorded and option to be displayed on the HQ and store manager level MTCICP. Digital displays can also be connected to the MTCICP. These can be programmed to present advertisements from brands that have paid to use the MTCICP. These ads can be displayed when a specific type of customer is in front of the display. The displays can also be movable, preprogrammed and connected. These can be tablets that are placed on fixed or movable display units that incorporate pre-programmed image recognition solutions. This image recognition solution can be connected to the MTCICP. The targets it is looking for can be selected and determined via the MTCICP by the store manager or the HQ or the brand owner who has been granted access against a fee. Once the image recognition system has made a match, content that is preloaded on the device can be triggered and displayed on the device. This interaction is an event and recorded as such by the MTCICP. The event can trigger an augmented reality representation of a product showcased in the target image, or it can be a promotional video, or an advertisement, a link to a web page, an interactive fact sheet, a presentation, photos, reviews, comparisons, data and fact sheets or any other aspect related to the image. All interactions are recorded and retained by the MTCICP. All results can be displayed as real time interactions on the store MTCICP or the HQ MTCICP.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

The objectives of such messages is to drive healthy behavior by sending motivational messages at the right time and on the right device, encouraging the user to make the right choices. These messages can then be answered by devices that can determine if the action was taken. This action can be to run faster, lift a weight, flex and arm or kick a ball. When the action has been completed, it can be recorded and if a reward is appropriate it can be awarded.

With this system, reminders can be sent at the right time. Rewards can be granted for the right behavior. This will then be repeated until a decreasing number of scheduled reminders are omitted. If the behavior remains, then the habit has been established. Rewards can be used as incentives along the process. Games can be used to encourage the right behavior. Such games can be made public or shared with a select group to instill competition.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

In office settings, an in active work in front of a compute can cause obesity. Simple reminders to stand up and be active are common features on wearable devices and mobile phones such as S-Health by Samsung and Apple Health by Apple. Such a device can be connected to the HWCICP which can then be connected with sensors in the facility. Now messages can be directed to those that are standing in front of an elevator. These messages can be to take the stairs instead. Only those that are standing by the elevator will get the message, while those that are walking by and continue on will not. Those that actually climb the stairs or walk down the stairs can be awarded. This action can be determined and recorded via proximity beacons in the stairwell, or by the activity sensors on the devices. The HWCICP will record and award rewards and points according to set parameters. These parameters can be defined and included in the message about taking the stairs.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

If they walk by, nothing happens. If they stop by the fountain or water cooler for a given period of time, the system can detect this and send a message to drink water. The action of standing by the water cooler or water fountain for a period of time—dwell time—can be used as verification that the person is drinking water. Such an event will be recorded by the HWCICP and points awarded.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

Suggestions on what to order can be presented on the users connected device by the HWCICP which detects the actual location. Message can be to present the menu of the cafeteria or option to connect with the vending machine. Should the user select an item from the cafeteria menu, the order will be gathered by the HWCICP. The event is recorded and the action will be to send that order to the Cafeteria system. This can be the cafeteria ordering system, a POS system, a dedicated device at the cafeteria or on the connected device of some of their staff. Such devices will be connected via the HWCICP with whatever connectivity they have. IN the case of the vending machine, the connection can be made directly or via cloud based servers and control system that can connect with the HWCICP.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

When such a tag is triggered by a HWCICP connected device, the system can detect that an action related to that NFC tag has occurred and be recorded by the HWCICP in the user's profile. This tag can be placed by a certain food in a cafeteria, by a turn still at an entry to a facility or on specific exercise equipment. The pairing of these tags can be used to determine what food the user is selecting in a cafeteria, what entry to the building they use (stairs or elevator) or what type of exercise the user is engaging in—is it a leg lift or arm curling machine.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

Special motivational messages can be displayed personalized to the person standing in front of the display. The user's personal communication device that is connected with the HWCICP will detect that the user is in proximity to the display. The display is also connected to the HWCICP. Once the pairing between the two connected devices has occurred, appropriate messages based on the programming of the HWCICP and any past demographical data and or profiles of the user, the location of the display and the activity around it.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

Using HWCIC to create gamification away from video games and TV screens that drives sedentary life style in the younger generation can be enabled to counter sedentary lifestyle. The same gamification can be used for today's office workers also sit at long period in front of computers. The ability to create messages such as encouraging activities and assigning points to these is a simple way to gamify—scavenger hunts that requires walking is a simple aspect. A more detailed and engaging feature can be to fit professional athletes or action movie stars with sensors and then track them as they perform their routines, shoot their baskets, score goals, run, ski, jump or do action movie motions. These actions can be recorded via body sensors and or video capture systems and captured in a HWCIC enabled platform. These actions then are recorded and retained. A user with a device such as a wearable, set of wearables, and or other sensors, can then try to replicate the movements, actions and or motions. Their performance is recorded and retained by their HWCIC connected devices. The user can then see how she or he compares in their motions against the expert. This can be against a set time, number or repetitions, speed, strength or accuracy that the expert achieved. The match and score against the expert can be presented on the user's HWCIC device real-time with an encouragement to repeat and improve. The experience can also be replayed or acted with virtual reality googles to create an immersive experience. The expert could have been filmed in a real world environment using one of the numerous 3D cameras with 360 degree capture. The same methodology can be used to enable participants to compete with each other. In such an instance each player has a device or devices connected to the HWCIC. Each player is identified in the HWCIC to compete against each other and each other have granted permission to the HWCIC and each other to participate and influence the game. The same methodology can be used to improve one's own game or performance. The initial run-through of the process can be completed using sensors that capture the motions such as motion capture sensors, and the actions and motions are recorded into the HWCIC. At a later time, the same motions are performed and the way these are performed can be matched real-time against what had been captured by the HWCIC in the previous instance. This can be used to improve a user's own performance, or the HWCIC can be a multi-tenant CICP where a sports team has the controls. They can then grant access to their trainers, medical, sports agents and others to monitor performance, monitor and verify improvements and detect where there may be problems. Corrective actions, suggested improvements and other actions can be programmed into the HWCIC to assist in behavior change.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

Time to consume food and drinks, vitamins, medications, supplements and the frequency and amounts of these can be programmed into the HWCIC. The HWCIC can then send messages and alerts about what to consume, and when and how much via HWCIC connected devices that the user has with him, is wearing or are within his context. He can confirm via the HWCIC connected devices that he has consumed the products or performed the actions. The HWCIC will retain and record this confirmation. Points can be assigned for the positive actions and retained by the HWCIC. Points can be deducted for failure to perform. Point status can be displayed on the user's device, on a public device or devices that are connected via the HWCIC and are permitted to see this information by the user, his team, his boss or employers, agents, teams, trainers, medical staff, supporters. As the action has been verified by the HWCIC, in addition or in-lieu of awarding points, the HWCIC can send an action to a sensor on the user to take a reading of his condition. This can be vital stats such as taking a heart rate pulse, moisture levels to measure sweat, blood sugar, glucose levels, oxygen levels or rate of speed of travel direction, height above ground, length of time airborne, power in turns and/or any other performance data and/or other stats on the conditions of the user. This can be used to measure levels of performance, accuracy or if the user may appear to have fallen, is there a pulse.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

When a user with a HWCIC connected device enters a grocery store, a restaurant, hotel, venue, airport or other place where he is likely to consume food and drinks, he can be reminded to select what is healthy. Confirmation that he chooses correct can be automatically in instances where a product packaging has a feature that includes an image recognizable by the HWCIC or a NFC tag that is associated with the product when this match is done in a manner recognized by the HWCIC. Offers to purchase healthy food can be provided with manual or automatically points awarded for right choices. This confirmation can be via object recognition systems, QR codes on the product packaging, NFC tags on the product. It can be confirmed via integration into the retailers POC system. It can be via product confirmation from devices such as Samsung fridge system that detects what products are in the fridge.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

Alerts and reminders to start to rest and slow down can be imitated via the HWCIC before the person needs to go to sleep. This can be motivational messages, turning on soothing audio sounds, running a hot bath, preparing a warm tea—all triggered and controlled via the HWCIC system that has been integrated into the user's home or hotel room or wherever he is sleeping.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

There are numerous solutions in the marketplace from wearables, to sensors in beds, to units to place on night stands. Any and all that are connected via Wi-Fi and has permissions via protocols to connect with other systems can be connected to the central HWCIC. The HWCIC thereby creates a multi-tenant HWCIC Smart home integration and master system.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

Once such embodiment of the invention is for a medical insurance company that encourages their members to go to a fitness gym. Such a program may give a discount to the member if he goes to the gym twice a week and are quite common place. When the insurance company implements a HWCIC to manage this program, the verification that the member goes to the gym can be automatically recorded. Each time and the number of times he enters the gym can be detected via geofences around the gym, beacon in the gym or NFC or other sensors in their facilities. These will interact with the member's mobile devices or wearables or sensors that are connected to the HWCICP. These interactions are recorded and retained as a proof of presence. The HWCICP can also be used to verify that the member is actually exercising by opening a heart right sensor or motion sensor that records movement and activity take a recording, record and retain this. This data can be retained by the HWCICP in the user's profile and or can be retained and recorded in a manner that remains anonymous. The action of going to the gym, the frequency, the times entering and exiting, the time there can all be recorded and retained by the HWCICP. Equipment, shoes, wearables and other sports and exercise tools can be fitted with sensors such as NFC tags or QR codes to validate, verify and record the use of these by the member via a connected wearable or mobile device that can communicate with the HWCICP or can retain the information for a period of time while out of range for communication with the HWCICP and transmit the collected, recorded and retain information and data when the connection is re-established with the HWCICP.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

The HWCICP can grant access to the gym attendance information, and the performance data there if user has granted rights to this to the accounting department of the insurance company. Alternatively, the HWCICP can be integrated into the insurance company accounting department database systems triggering a reduction in premiums for the user.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

In such an instance, the customer is a patient, the staff is nurses, and the store admin is replaced by the hospital admin staff. Instead of recording when standing in front of products, the patient's location will be mapped as he moves from examination room to examination room to laboratory and other facilities across the hospital. Instead of presenting content about a product, the MTCICP can present information about the patient. Should the hospital have a HIPPA compliant version of the MTCICP, electronic health records can be presented to the nurses, admins and physicians who have HIPPA compliant mobile devices that are connected to the MTCICP when they are in proximity to the patient. The path and movement of the patient can be recorded and retained by the HIPPA compliant MTCICP platform.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>
</span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;p<span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">id</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">p-0434</span>"</span><span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">num</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">0433</span>"</span>&gt;</span><span>This system can also be extended to patient care post operations. There is a big issues currently regarding re-admit within 30 days of discharge. It is of great importance to the physicians to ensure that patients make the follow up appointments with their primary care physician within 48 hours of discharge. It is also of great importance that the patient follows the routines and regiments of care required and prescribed by the discharge physicians and nurses. The proper intake of the prescribed medicine in right dosage at the right time is also vital. Finally, there is a need to inform and educate the patient about the procedure the just had performed, with a mean to contact the right care give should the patient have any concerns or if problems occur.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>
</span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;p<span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">id</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">p-0435</span>"</span><span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">num</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">0434</span>"</span>&gt;</span><span>The use of a MTCICP system can enable these things to happen. A patient that is being discharged will typically receive a print out of the their prescribed medications, paper forms with instructions, phone directory on a paper or phone book and other written notes and documents printed on paper. A MTCICP solution can add to this with a tablet that has been pre-programmed with all the relevant information around the procedure. Links to websites, videos and other information can be pre-programmed into this tablet. The user interface can be customized for easy navigation for seeing impaired people, elderly or those with limited dexterity in their hands and arms. Voice or gesture controls can also be included in this tablet.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>
</span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;p<span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">id</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">p-0436</span>"</span><span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">num</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">0435</span>"</span>&gt;</span><span>The tablet is connected with the MTCICP via cellular network so it is always connected. Easy to use tabs to connect the patient with the care team can also be included. Once the patient makes a request for connection, the connection will be made via the MTCICP or in such a fashion that the MTCICP captures and records the connection attempt. It can ensure that the right care giver is connected. If that care giver is also part of the MTCICP, he or she can have a mobile device that is connected to the MTCICP and alerts the care giver when the request for contact has been made by the patient. As part of the discharge kit a wearable such as a Samsung Gear S2 watch can be given, lent, sold or leased to the patient. This device is also connected via cellular network to the MTCICP. As part of its preloaded mobile application, the MTCICP can open up sensors on this device upon certain events. These events can be event such as when acceleration is recorded by the device which the on-board chips will calculate to indicate that the wearer of the watch has fallen. Then the watch can sound an alarm to alert the user, it can make a connection to the MTCICP and sound an alarm via its connections, it can open up its heart rate sensor and take 2 readings, and seek any other motions or sounds. If these indicate a fall and that the wearer of the watch is in distress, the watch can send an emergency alert to the MTCICP and call 911. Since the unit has a cell unit and SIM card in it, the MTCICP can route a voice call to the unit and the 911 operator can also engage a voice call. Since the unit operates on the cell network, location can be detected and ported to the 911 service. The unit can also present medication alerts and reminders in non-emergency situations. These can be triggered by the MTCICP and displayed on the watch face with an alarm and vibration trigger. The patient can acknowledge that he is taking the medication. Such a response can be retained by the MTCICP as an indication that the patient is complying with the medication regiment prescribed. If of interest to the prescribing physician or discharge team, the watch can be programmed to take a hear rate reading before the message is sent, and after the patient has confirmed that he has consumed the medication. All such recordings will be recorded and retained by the MTCICP. Should the patient want to contact some of his care givers, the connections can be presented via the MTCICP. Such a message can be similar to a “nurse call” button in the hospital room, with the direct connection to on-staff nurses enabled. It is of great interest to the medical team, the hospital administrator and other care givers and family members that the patient can get the appropriate care at the right time. Early warning signs of a worsening condition can be detected earlier and prevented. One such issue is rapid weight gain post heart operation. Should a scale with the ability to be connected via WiFi or cellular network be prescribed as part of the discharge kit, reminders to measure weight and recording of these can detect warning signs before they become life threatening. Any other connected device that measures health statics or data can be connected with the MTCICP. Nearly equally important to the hospital operators, owners and admins is to intercept patients that are returning to the hospital or any other care giver within the 30 days without a critical need. The hospital that performed the operation may in such an instance forfeit the payment for the original operation and or be subject to a fine. In many instances, it may be more economical to send a trained professional nurse or doctor or other care giver to the location that the patient is at. The MTCICP can assist in administrating and coordinating such efforts to preemptive intercept an early re-admit. Any such staff member that has a device that is connected to the MTCICP and is on duty can be directed to go to the location of the patient to ascertain if the patient really needs to be readmitted. The MTCICP can also be used to enable additional uses of the discharge kit components such as smart home controls via gesture controls of the Samsung Gear S2 with the MTCICP capturing all interactions, with the ability to detect trends such as diminishing activity levels or weaker movements. Such trends can cause the MTCICP to send an alert to care givers.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

Equipment is mobile and often needed in an emergency resulting in no actual tracking of where it was taken from, how long it was used and where it was placed after it was no longer needed for that particular situation.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>
</span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;p<span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">id</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">p-0439</span>"</span><span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">num</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">0438</span>"</span>&gt;</span><span>Such equipment can have a sensor placed on it. This sensor could be a Bluetooth LE sensor. This sensor is associated with the equipment in the MTCICP. Whenever a member of staff that has a device that is connected with the MTCICP comes in proximity to that specific piece of equipment, that interaction is recorded and retained by the MTCICP. It will retain the information about the equipment, where the staff member was when the interaction started, the time it occurred, how long it lasted and at what time the proximity ended and where the staff member was at that time. The location of the piece of equipment is thereby detected, recorded and retained by the MTCICP and can instantly or at a later time be displayed in the MTCICP or on any other device connected with the MTCICP that has the right credentials to have access to this information. This ‘last known location’ is another aspect of the MTCICP.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>
</span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;p<span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">id</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">p-0440</span>"</span><span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">num</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">0439</span>"</span>&gt;</span><span>Such an MTCICP system can also track, locate and alert about assets in locations without the MTCICP infrastructure of sensors. Such an embodiment can be the use of the MTCICP for baggage tracking and alerts. A Bluetooth LE beacon can be placed on a piece of baggage and identified via a mobile device that has an app that communicates with the MTCICP. It can be logged as related to that specific device and the specific piece of luggage and recoded as such in the MTCICP. Once the traveler checks in his luggage at the departing airport, the proximity is broken and recorded and retained by the MTCICP. Once the traveler arrives at is arrival airport, his device will recognize the location as an airport via geo-fences preprogrammed in the MTCICP. It will start listening for the BLE beacon assigned with the person's device. Once the luggage arrives on the luggage conveyer belt, proximity is detected and the mobile device will sound an alarm, shake or otherwise alert the user that his luggage has arrived and is ready to be collected. Should the first airport be a connecting airport, the user will not connect with his luggage and the alert is not sent. All of these events and actions are transmitted to the MTCICP and recorded with location and time—and retained.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>
</span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;p<span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">id</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">p-0441</span>"</span><span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">num</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">0440</span>"</span>&gt;</span><span>Another embodiment of the MTCICP is the ability to present actions such as enabling on-device order of products such as food and beverages when in proximity to a facility that has a MTCICP connection. The mobile device is then also connected to the MTCICP and when the user approaches the facility, the menu can be presented. In app and on the device selection of the products can be recorded by the device and the selection presented as an order on the device. Once confirmed by the user, the order will be transmitted to the MTCICP. The MTCICP will then transmit the order to the facility's connect devices. This can be a display, a mobile device that is fixed or mobile, a mobile device used by some of the staff member or directly into the facility's point of purchase system. Any of these systems will be connected to the MTCICP and will send a confirmation message back to the originating device. Information about the person that placed the order will also be transmitted to the facility via the MTCICP. This can be a photo of the user or the identification of the user's mobile device. A payment for the products ordered can also be facilitated via the MTCICP. Using any of the multiple mobile payment solutions such as Apple Pay or Google Pay, the tender can be closed when the user receives the products ordered. In one such instance, a 27 year old male person visiting from another town has a mobile watch such as a Samsung Gear S2 watch. Once he enters a crowded bar that has access to a MTCICP and installation in place, he is presented an offer to order a Coke and Bacardi on his wrist watch. He presses yes, and the MTCICP transmits the order to the bar tender's personal mobile device that is also connected to the MTCICP. He confirms receipt of the order and sees the FaceBook profile photo of the user. As the user approaches the bar, the bartender recognizes him and hands him his drink. The user acknowledges receipt of his drink on his watch and the tender is closed and payment arranged via the MTCICP. In this instance, Bacardi had access to the MTCICP. They have paid the owner of the system to be allowed to present offers for drinks using Bacardi Rom to male persons travelling that are between age of 25 and 30. This is why the offer for the Bacardi was presented instead of an offer for a Vodka martini. The order includes a handling fee that is automatically included in the cost. This is shared by the owner of the MTCICP and the facility in a predetermined revenue share agreement. The order also includes an automatic % for tip that will be paid to the bar staff. In another impediment of the same MTCICP order solution, a busy mom is travelling with her twin 3 year old boys. She arrives at the airport where the MTCICP has been installed. The MTCICP has guided her through the shortest lines through security. She has signed up for a health and fitness tracker version of the system. Her pulse is recorded as she has passed through security. The struggles with security and 2 unruly three year old boys have caused her stress levels to be elevated. The MTCICP recognizes this elevated stress level. It matches her with her profile of being a mother of young children. A newsstand is located across the gate where she has sat down with her boys trying to calm them. There are no food concessionaires at this area of the airport. Her watch pings her gently. It displays a message on the display asking if she could use a bottle of water and some packages of fruits for her boys that has been sent from the MTCICP.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>
</span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;p<span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">id</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">p-0442</span>"</span><span class="html-attribute"> <span class="html-attribute-name">num</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">0441</span>"</span>&gt;</span><span>She states yes. This confirmation is now sent to the newsstand that carries both via the MTCICP. The order is confirmed via the system and displayed on the woman's watch. An option to have this delivered to her is offered at a fee, and she confirms she wants this. This request is again sent via the MTCICP to the newsstand. The order is now carried by a staff member or other service provider who has a device that is connected to the MTCICP. The location of the woman is shown on the device this staff member has with her. Once the connection is made, the order is closed and payment procured in the preferred manner of the woman; cash, credit card or via the MTCICP enabled watch.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

She now moves to this new gate with her two sons in tow. They are all getting hungry, but she does not want to risk leaving the gate. Now she uses her mobile phone that is also connected to the MTCICP to see what restaurants are close by inside the airport and offer the same delivery service. She can see a couple of fast food restaurants nearby, but the lines are long and boys even more on edge. She finds a healthy alternative in a restaurant in the opposite side of the terminal. She places an order for a salad for herself and two healthy sandwiches and apples for her boys. She selects “deliver to me” and “initiate beacon tracking” on her phone. The order and the action are transmitted to the MTCICP. The “initiate beacon tracking” feature of the MTCICP enabled app opens up the BLE signal transmitter on the phone. The ID of the phone is retained by the MTCICP and included with the order. As the order has been transmitted, placed and processed at the restaurant, all this information is sent to the person carrying the food. His MTCICP connected device has a map of the area where the woman is. But this is a very crowded area with frustrated and delayed travelers. Everyone is on edge because of the two hungry and unruly boys. The server will use his device to see signal strength of the BLE signal being transmitted from the woman's phone. As he gets closer, the signal gets stronger, should he move in the wrong direction, it gets weaker. They meet up quickly despite the crowded area.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

Now as he approaches the display banks of the flights, the beacon that is associated with that specific display that is also connected to the MTCICP recognizes that he is in proximity to this display. This verification that he is in front of this particular display will be recorded by the MTCICP. It will match him with his flight information that is retained by his mobile device. As he approached his flight number will be instructed from the MTCICP to flash, have a name by it, have his initials by it, have a border around it, be highlighted or some other ways be made to stand out. This will last for a duration programmed and determined by the MTCICP. It can be based on how many other people who also have devices that are connected to the MTCICP are standing in front of that display. It can be flashing as long as he stands there and stop when he walks away. It can be on for a few seconds. His device that is connected to the MTCICP can be programmed to import the flight gate information onto the device. Indoor way finding can then be provided by the MTCICP to guide the user to his gate.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

This can be used to communicate with professionals when there is a problem at a certain location. It can be used to alert about equipment failures or damages. This can range from a faulty faucet or overflowing WC, a broken pipe or a spill of liquids on a floor, to faulty escalator, elevator or moving walkway, a broken window, or other structural damages. It can be an issue such as a fire, a person that is hurt or ill, a person that needs service, a person that needs help moving in a wheel chair, temperature that is too high or too low, it can be a piece of electronic equipment or display or tool that is malfunctioning. When such an event is recorded as an issue of concern via sensors that are connected to the MTCICP, or sensors that can alert other devices that are connected to the MTCICP such as a mobile device used by those in the vicinity of the issue, or the user of such a mobile device activates the issue of the concern, the MTCICP records this issue as an event. The event then triggers an action or series of actions. Such an action can be to alert the staff that has devices that are connected to the MTCICP that and are in proximity to the event or has some other interaction or control or authority of the event. This alert will then be displayed on the staff member's mobile device that is connected to the MTCICP. Content, instructions and information about the issue at hand can be delivered as well so that the staff member is fully informed and educated about the issue at hand. When the staff member has acknowledged that he is addressing the issue the MTCICP will also record and retain this information. Should the staff member be unable to fix, correct or handle the issue, he can use his device that is connected to the MTCICP to alert staff members to assist. The MTCICP will then send messages to these via their connected devices with actions to take. The MTCICP can also escalate issues of importance to those with a higher authority or to the master license holder or the owner of the MTCICP based on predetermined algorithms, alert triggers or if-then commands.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

The hospital has installed a CICP system to communicate with its patients, enabling the hospital to communicate with their patients when they are at the premises, before and after, pre-care and post-operation—via mobile devices that are connected to CICP that they wear or carry with them as they move across the hospital setting. Nurses, administrators, staff, cleaning staff and physicians also carry mobile devices that are also connected to the CICP. These devices function as input units as well as displaying content that is relevant to the individual staff member and relevant to the location they are in, their context or those nearby in proximity. The CICP can also be connected with equipment and digital signage and screens throughout the facility outside the entry, in the lobby, by elevators, outside and inside examination rooms, inside and outside operation rooms, inside and outside recovery rooms and patient rooms, inside and outside nurse stations, inside and outside waiting rooms, inside and outside physician's offices, in hallways, in stairwells, outside, inside and throughout cafeteria, outside, inside, and throughout pharmacy, outside, inside and throughout waiting rooms, outside, inside and throughout gift shops, in operations, in restrooms—throughout the facility wherever a digital sign can provide value. Sensors such as proximity beacons, NFC tags and other sensors can be placed at known locations across each of the same locations. Multiple sensors can be placed in larger areas. Some sensors can be powered by batteries, solar panels or attached to power supply. This power supply can be electrical outlets or USB ports in PCs, TVs or digital displays. These sensors and the displays are connected to the CICP and their unit and location is known by the CICP. Other sensors and proximity beacons will be placed throughout the facilities. These can be low cost Bluetooth low energy proximity beacons. None of these require connectivity or WiFi. The location of all these are known. These locations can be displayed on a digital map presented by the CICP in dashboard accessible via cloud based computers for those that have been granted access. When a person with a mobile device that is connected with the CICP comes into connection with one of these sensors or beacons, then this connected device alerts the CICP that the proximity or connection with that specific device has been established. The CICP can then detect the proximity of that user in relation to this specific sensor. To determine more exact location, triangulation between 3 node points with known location can be achieved using any standard triangulation methods or out of the box indoor navigation solution. The sensors are not connected to the CICP, the connection to the CICP occur via the mobile device the person is wearing. Numerous persons can thereby be displayed on the CICP without the need for connectivity beyond network and/or Wi-Fi that connects the devices. In addition to this system, a movable piece of equipment can be fitted with a proximity beacon. This can be a battery powered beacon or one that is connected to a power supply within the piece of equipment or on a rechargeable battery pack. This beacon's id number is logged into the CICP and assigned with that particular piece of equipment such as a hospital bed. This hospital bed is located in room </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>1</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>A. A staff member enters room </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>1</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>A and the CICP records the time and location of the entry of the staff member into room </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>1</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>A and retains this information. The staff member walks to the bed and starts moving the rollable bed. The proximity beacon on the bed triggers a proximity alert on the staff member's connected device. This connection is transmitted to the CICP which records the interaction, the time and the location of the staff member in room </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>1</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>A. Staff member moves the bed into the hall way and to the elevators. Proximity beacons along the way records the entry and exit of their range with the staff member's mobile device, which is sending this information to the CICP. At each interaction, the bed is still in proximity to the staff member's mobile device and this proximity is also noted. The staff member enters the elevator and connectivity to his device is lost while in the elevator. The CICP records and retains this lost connection as a last known location. The staff member exits the elevator on the second floor. His device connects with the proximity beacon at the 2</span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;sup&gt;</span><span>nd </span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/sup&gt;</span></div><span>floor elevator lobby, and this connection is recorded and transmitted to the CICP. Location of the staff member is thereby re-established. He is still in proximity to the bed. The beacon on the bed is also in range with the staff member's connected device. This device then communicates the location of the bed to be the same as the staff member. The staff member walks down the corridor and the same procedure as on floor </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>1</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span> repeats with the mobile device alerting the CICP as it comes in and out of range of the beacons in the corridor. Real time location of the staff member is thereby captured. Each time, the proximity of the staff member's mobile device and the bed is detected, captured and transmitted to the CICP. The location of the bed is thereby also inferred. The staff member arrives at room </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>2</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>B and enters. The beacon in Room </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>2</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>B interacts with his mobile device and transmits to the CICP, the location of the staff member in room </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>2</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>B is thereby detected. The proximity of the bed to the staff member is also detected and transmitted to the CICP. The location of the bed in room </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>2</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>B can thereby be determined, recorded and retained. The staff member now leaves the bed in room </span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;b&gt;</span><span>2</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div><span>B and moves into the corridor. His mobile device connects with the signals from the proximity beacons in the hallway and transmits these interactions with the CICP. At this state he is not in proximity to the bed any longer. The past proximity with the bed beacon is broken and it is recorded as an “exit” between the beacon on the bed and the staff member's device, and this is also included as information sent by the device to the CICP. The location where the last proximity was detected between the bed beacon and the staff member's mobile device will be noted in the CIPC as the “last known location” and retained by the CICP as the most likely location of the bed.</span></div><span class="folded hidden">...</span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div></div><span>

It can then provide information and directions to this last known location directly onto mobile devices of other staff members. This can be provided via active search, or directional instructions, or alphanumerical displays of the location of each asset that has an identifying tag. Displays placed in sections of the hospital can provide lists of the assets that are close to it or on the same floor—with directions to them. This information is provided by the CICP. When a staff member stands in front of the display, this proximity is detected by the CICP and the location and information can be transmitted to the staff member's device that is connected to the CICP.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

When this staff member leaves the room without the bed, the last know location is recorded. When another member enters the room with another device the process is repeated. When that member leaves the room with the bed, the process from the first staff member leaving room la is repeated. The location of the asset—the bed—is therefore active and real-time when in proximity and being actively moved by a staff member, when it is stationary the last known location is displayed.</span></div><span class="folded hidden">...</span><div class="line"><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div></div><span>
