Simply knowing that merchandise movement is occurring in areas susceptible to theft activity can provide the store team with increased awareness so actions can be taken to reduce these sources of shrink. Detection and prompt notification of activity typical of a sweep (rapid removal of multiple items) heightens urgency and enables store team members to take actions that can safely circumvent costly in-process sweeps.</span>

However, this is prohibitively expensiveâwhile item level tags might be justifiable on higher cost items likely to be stolen, it remains prohibitively costly to purchase and install RFID readers capable of covering an entire store. The present invention, while providing a less elegant approach, is far less costly and still provides an awareness that helps store staff</span>

As product is removed, the tag is sensed. These are sometimes used with product pushers or other merchandising systems. Though this approach can be much more accurate in detecting an actual removal/replacement of product than the invention and can also detect shelf-stock-outs, the cost to cover a shelf is enormous in terms of the equipment required, installation of tags and readers (AC power is required), and the very significant cost of ongoing reconfiguration as merchandise planograms change.</span>

By comparison, the invention can detect each merchandise dispense from any and all pushers on an entire shelving unit (i.e., multiple shelves on a rack) with a single wireless device, providing a much lower cost path to much of these benefits.</span>

        <span itemprop="definition">are typically anti-sweep mechanisms for razor blades, baby formula, and certain other high cost items that help avoid sweeps by only permitting one item to be taken at a time. These dispensing units can be quite costly and multiple items can still be removed from most of these dispensers, if only one at a time. This provides yet another application for the present invention, which can detect the unique vibration signature created with each dispense by most of these devices (as well as detect malicious efforts to gain entry into them) and drive awareness to the store team of these events.</span>

        <span itemprop="subject">Japanese patent application 1998-140263 submitted by Tsutomu Tachibana</span>
        <span itemprop="definition">describes triggering a musical sound on a nearby speaker (triggered by a radio transmission) when vibration on a merchandise display occurs. This would increase awareness of potential theft activity but the lack of intelligent event filtering would result in numerous notifications without regard for the likely urgency of the event or the ability of the store staff to respond, eventually reducing these notifications to background âwhite noiseâ that is increasingly ignored by store staff, negating the entire value of the device. The inability of the device to route specific location messages to various wireless communication devices typically used by store staff also seriously limits broad implementation of such a solution set. While the Tachibana approach and the present invention both use an accelerometer for sensing, the processing of that activity resulting in appropriate categorized alarm levels being delivered to appropriate store staff members provides improvements supporting ongoing effectiveness.</span>

More particularly, the present invention pertains to awareness of behaviors often related to potential theft activity, such as the removal of large quantities of items from a shelf in a short period of time, typical of a thief âsweepingâ a shelf of all products in a hurry. Upon detecting such activity, the device (herein âSmartDomeâ) actively makes its presence known, inherently making SmartDome more threatening to a thief, since it is âawareâ of suspicious behaviors, and because SmartDome brings this activity to the attention of store personnel via automated notification. While this enhanced device looks similar to conventional ceiling-mounted cameras, it differs in its ability to âgo activeâ based on detected suspicious behaviors and thereby inherently deters theft and/or causes store personnel or other actions to accomplish this goal.</div>

    <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div id="p-0007" num="0006" class="description-line">Retailers suffer enormous losses due to theft of merchandise from the sales floorârecent studies peg this loss at $15.7 billion in 2013-2014 in the United States alone (www.GlobalRetailTheftBarometer.com). While some of this is due to individual shoplifters, an increasing proportion of the loss is through Organized Retail Crime (hereinafter âORCâ) shoplifting rings that typically use âbooster teamsâ to sweep large quantities of select merchandise from store shelves. Shoplifters and boosters alike try very hard to escape the notice of store teams by distracting the store team or otherwise lifting merchandise in store areas not likely to be immediately noticed. Simply knowing that merchandise movement is occurring in areas susceptible to theft activity can provide the store team with increased awareness so actions can be taken to reduce these sources of shrink. Detection and prompt notification of activity typical of a sweep (rapid removal of multiple items) heightens urgency and enables store team members to take actions that can safely circumvent costly in-process sweeps.</div>
    </li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div id="p-0008" num="0007" class="description-line">In order to reduce and even prevent ORC, retailers employ various strategies to monitor merchandise shopper interactions. The following examples represent some of the known strategies and why there remains a need for improved merchandise activity sensing.</div>
    </li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div id="p-0009" num="0008" class="description-line">RFID Item-Level Tags: Placing an RFID tag on every item of interest in a store and placing an RFID reader within range of all merchandise displays can provide an excellent and superior method of detecting suspicious events (e.g., theft), stock positon, and other valuable information. However, this is prohibitively expensiveâwhile item level tags might be justifiable on higher cost items likely to be stolen, it remains prohibitively costly to purchase and install RFID readers capable of covering an entire store. The present invention, while providing a less elegant approach, is far less costly and still provides an awareness that helps store staff</div>
    </li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div id="p-0010" num="0009" class="description-line">âNeWave Smart Shelfâ by NeWave Sensor Solutions uses RFID technology but instead of placing the RFID tags on the products, the tags are mounted on the shelves such that the placement of merchandise on the tag blocks the reading of that tag. As product is removed, the tag is sensed. These are sometimes used with product pushers or other merchandising systems. Though this approach can be much more accurate in detecting an actual removal/replacement of product than the invention and can also detect shelf-stock-outs, the cost to cover a shelf is enormous in terms of the equipment required, installation of tags and readers (AC power is required), and the very significant cost of ongoing reconfiguration as merchandise planograms change.</div>
    </li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div id="p-0011" num="0010" class="description-line">Shopperception uses a 3D detection device mounted above a merchandise interaction fixture to detect reaches into the fixture and removal/replacement of merchandise located at specific vertical plane X/Y coordinates. This is an excellent method for detecting these interactions and can be much more accurate than the invention, however, it also involves very expensive equipment that is costly to install and not practical for use at a significant number of merchandise fixtures throughout all stores in a chain. For those applications requiring less precision, the invention is economically a preferred approach.</div>
    </li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div id="p-0012" num="0011" class="description-line">Adhesive Tethers are typically used with expensive display merchandise (such as cameras and cell phones) to permit shoppers to hold the item within the range of a retractable tether.

Though ubiquitous, these systems have little effect in deterring boosters (or even seasoned shoplifters) as the EAS alarm simply indicates that merchandise has just left the store and most retailers do not pursue suspects outside of the store. By comparison, a primary use of the present invention raises staff awareness at the location in the store where the merchandise is displayed, which can provide store staff with the opportunity to actually deter the theft or provide needed customer assistance. Likewise, a second use of the invention (in which a location sensing method is incorporated and the device is attached directly to high-value merchandise) provides a means of notification when an item is approaching the exit area but is still well away from the exit itself, which permits raising awareness, triggering of video capture, and other actions prior to exit.</div>

The inability of the device to route specific location messages to various wireless communication devices typically used by store staff also seriously limits broad implementation of such a solution set.

However, many stores find sales conversions and total sales tickets frequently increase if sales clerks approach shoppers when they are interacting with certain categories of merchandiseâeven when the shopper has not determined or indicated that assistance is desired.

This is accomplished by increasing the perceived risk a thief experiences versus the expected reward from selling the stolen goods. Ideally, this should occur at the shelf, at the moment the thief has to commit to steal. Perceived risk is created by anti-theft devices located at the point of theft, these devices have the potential to lead to an apprehension of the thief by store personnel.â The mantra of the LPRC is SEE IT, GET IT, FEAR IT This means the thief should very quickly see the deterrent device, get it in the sense of knowing it is an anti-theft device, and fear it, meaning a heightened perception of the risk of apprehension.</div>

The act of removing merchandise from a display fixture induces vibration into the fixture. The Merchandise Activity Sensor (MAS), which is a battery powered wireless device, mounts to the store fixture and uses an integral single or multi-axis accelerometer to detect these vibrations. Various algorithms comprising combinations of vibration level, discernible vibration events, timing of events, quantity of events, and (in some cases) frequency content of the vibration signal are used to determine when the vibration pattern is an event of modest interest (such as typical shopping or possible shopliftingâa â<figure-callout id="1" label="Type" filenames="US20190088096A1-20190321-D00004.png,US20190088096A1-20190321-D00006.png" state="{{state}}">Type</figure-callout> 1 Alarmâ) or of high interest (such as a possible sweep incidentâa â<figure-callout id="2" label="Type" filenames="US20190088096A1-20190321-D00004.png,US20190088096A1-20190321-D00006.png" state="{{state}}">Type</figure-callout> 2 Alarmâ).

The invention then recognizes trends correlating the repeated presence of identified person(s) with coincident EOIs across multiple visits at one or more store locations. A high correlation level results in the declaration of such an identified person as a Person of Interest (POI). Each POI is assigned a threat rating typically driven by degree of POI identification certainty and associated loss level (e.g., estimated theft per visit, frequency of visits, and total history of attributable incidents). Appropriate store team, loss prevention professionals, and/or remote video monitoring personnel may then be notified in real time of the presence of such POIs (and their threat rating) as soon as practicable upon entry to a store and/or when an EOI is detected when one or more POI&#39;s are present. This empowers these resources to proactively take appropriate actions to deter or apprehend.</div>
    </li> <li> <para-num num="[0036]"> </para-num> <div id="p-0037" num="0036" class="description-line">The invention may be implemented to seek identification markers for persons routinely (i.e., before an EOI occurs, then linking such identified persons to an EOI occurring coincident with the identified person(s) presence). Alternatively, it may seek identification markers of those present only when an EOI occurs. Either way, since the invention relies upon trends and not an isolated incident to assign POI status, linkage accuracy between a given EOI and persons in the vicinity of the EOI is not critical. For example, detected rapid removal of a large quantity of merchandise from a shelf (an EOI) is atypical shopping behavior, but typical of ORC boosters. Depending upon the person identification method(s) used, the system may link multiple nearby persons to the EOIâperhaps every identified person in the entire store. Some of these identified persons may be the actual perpetrators and some just uninvolved shoppers. In the case of repeat offenses by the same identified person(s), over time the invention will declare the actual perpetrators as POI&#39;s then increase their associated threat level as additional offenses are detected. Meanwhile, uninvolved shoppers identified in the vicinity of an EOI remain statistically irrelevant in this process.</div>

This is typically accomplished by using a readily mounted and identifiable form factor (e.g., a dome camera) and enhancing that device by proactively drawing the potential thief&#39;s attention to the camera based upon actions actually occurring in the store. Note that the term âcameraâ typically refers to a real or dummy dome camera, though other camera form factors could also be used. Two of the most common dome camera configurations are shown below (opaque or semi-opaque domes in which the camera is difficult or impossible to see and non-dome or clear dome Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras, on which the camera lens can be readily seen).</div>

    </li> <heading id="h-0009">Alarm Algorithms:</heading>
    <li> <para-num num="[0084]"> </para-num> <div id="p-0085" num="0084" class="description-line">Various algorithms determine alarm conditions. Vibration amplitude, duration of vibration, and repeated incidents of vibration activities are most commonly evaluated for alarm determination. However, frequency domain information using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) or other analysis may also be used to identify specific vibration signatures relevant to certain types of events. The following provide high level descriptions for anticipated algorithms and outcomes applicable to MAS:
</div> </li> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0085">Gondola Shelving: Tests confirm that all shelving on a gondola unit can be monitored by a single MAS. Vibration induced into the shelving transmits through the uprights and into the backboard, where the MAS typically mounts. The algorithm sensitivity level is dependent upon the type of merchandise on the shelves (e.g., heavy or light). It should be noted that while a single MAS can be used to detect activity anywhere on a gondola, it is sometimes advantageous to mount a MAS on each shelving unit so as to more precisely identify the merchandise being moved.</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0086">Pallet Rack Shelving: Pallet rack shelving is typical of large DIY warehouse stores. Like gondolas, a MAS can typically detect merchandise movement on multiple shelves of pallet rack shelving. However, due to the heavy construction of these fixtures, for best detection on some types of merchandise, the MAS would mount directly to the bottom of a shelf. Also like gondolas, algorithm sensitivity is dependent on merchandise type.</li> <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0087">Peg Hooks: Tests have shown excellent detection of merchandise removal from gondola peg hooks mounted anywhere on a monitored pegboard. This removal generates a very characteristic vibration signature that is readily detected. Multiple incidences of this signature across a limited time frame is used to distinguish between typical shopping behavior (<figure-callout id="1" label="Type" filenames="US20190088096A1-20190321-D00004.png,US20190088096A1-20190321-D00006.png" state="{{state}}">Type</figure-callout> 1 Alarms) and possible sweep activity (<figure-callout id="2" label="Type" filenames="US20190088096A1-20190321-D00004.png,US20190088096A1-20190321-D00006.png" state="{{state}}">Type</figure-callout> 2 alarms). Monitoring can also be effective on peg hooks and hangers mounted to slat panels, wire racks, and other fixtures that support hanging merchandise.</li> <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0088">Locked Peg Hooks: Peg hooks with integral locking mechanisms, which require assistance from sales staff to access the desired merchandise, are commonly used to reduce theft of high-value items. Thieves sometimes circumvent this by cutting the merchandise packaging to remove the item. MAS can detect this cutting activity due to the vibration induced into the fixture.</li> <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0089">Cardboard Fixtures: Many stores use temporary fixtures constructed of cardboard or corrugated plastic. Testing confirms that algorithms similar to those effective on gondola shelving will also perform well on these temporary fixtures.</li> <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0090">Clothing Hangers: Testing has not been performed to characterize clothes hanger fixtures typical of apparel stores. However, it is predicted that the movement of a hangar will create a readily identifiable vibration signature.</li> <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0091">Merchandise Pushers: When an item is removed from a pusher and the remaining merchandise snaps forward, a very characteristic vibration signature is generatedâthis is readily detected by MAS from any pusher on an entire gondola unit. This means MAS can readily determine a fairly accurate count of dispenses, which is then used to define <figure-callout id="1" label="Type" filenames="US20190088096A1-20190321-D00004.png,US20190088096A1-20190321-D00006.png" state="{{state}}"> <figure-callout id="2" label="Type" filenames="US20190088096A1-20190321-D00004.png,US20190088096A1-20190321-D00006.png" state="{{state}}">Type</figure-callout> </figure-callout> 1 and 2 alarms. Also, a large vibration amplitude typically indicates removal of multiple items from a single facing, which can also be used to declare a <figure-callout id="2" label="Type" filenames="US20190088096A1-20190321-D00004.png,US20190088096A1-20190321-D00006.png" state="{{state}}">Type</figure-callout> 2 alarm. There are two unique advantages when using MAS with pushers versus most other merchandising systems: Dispenses can be distinguished from placing the merchandise back into the pusher, making the dispense detection alarms much more definitive; and dispenses of the last item in a pusher facing (constituting stock-out of that facing) creates a vibration signature uniquely identifiable relative to other dispenses. This enables MAS to detect this stock-out and send a unique alarm message to that effect. In some cases, metal âtapsâ or other devices may be attached to the pusher to make this stock-out dispense even more identifiable due to high vibration amplitude, distinctive duration and/or frequency, or multiple sharp vibration spikes (âringingâ).</li> <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0092">Merchandise Dispensers (with clickers): A number of anti-sweep merchandise dispensers require shoppers to turn a knob or take a similar action to dispense each product item. These knobs often incorporate a âclickerâ that creates a clicking sound intended to raise store employee awareness of the event (i.e., an extended clicking session might indicate a sweep in progress). The MAS can detect these clicks when the dispensers and MAS are mounted on the same gondola assembly. Each click emits a readily identifiable vibration signature and the MAS can be calibrated with the quantity of clicks equating to a single dispense. From this, <figure-callout id="1" label="Type" filenames="US20190088096A1-20190321-D00004.png,US20190088096A1-20190321-D00006.png" state="{{state}}"> <figure-callout id="2" label="Type" filenames="US20190088096A1-20190321-D00004.png,US20190088096A1-20190321-D00006.png" state="{{state}}">Type</figure-callout> </figure-callout> 1 and 2 Alarm events can be declared. In some types of dispensers a facing stock-out event can be detected using methods similar to merchandise pushers (a form of which are often incorporated in these dispensers).</li> <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0093">Ambient Vibration Auto-Adjust: Some store environments, such as sales floors in multiple-story buildings, may have ambient vibration levels induced into the fixtures due to HVAC equipment or other sources. The MAS can be configured to automatically adjust its base detection threshold to normalize out this ambient vibration while still enabling the unit to detect events of interest.</li> <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0094">Alarm Learn Mode: While algorithms are typically defined based on the factors previously outlined, an alternative method is to place the MAS into âLearn Modeâ then perform events that minimally define a <figure-callout id="1" label="Level" filenames="US20190088096A1-20190321-D00004.png,US20190088096A1-20190321-D00006.png" state="{{state}}">Level</figure-callout> 1 and a <figure-callout id="2" label="Level" filenames="US20190088096A1-20190321-D00004.png,US20190088096A1-20190321-D00006.png" state="{{state}}">Level</figure-callout> 2 Alarm. MAS will then auto-set these variables (such as sensitivity threshold and quantity of events within an elapsed time period) to detect similar events in the future. The preferred method of invoking learn mode and entering relevant information can be performed using a smart mobile device (linked to the system Controller or directly to the MAS using various wireless technologies), a computer linked to the System controller locally or remotely, an infrared controller (similar to a television remote control) communicating directly to the MAS device through an infrared portal, or even using switches integral to the MAS device.</li> <li id="ul0002-0011" num="0095">Tamper Alarm: Once the MAS is mounted and calibrated, its multi-axis accelerometer senses orientation (i.e., which way is down). An unexpected dismounting of the device can be quickly detected by the device and designated a Tamper Event, which would typically create a very aggressive local annunciation and the transmission of a Tamper Alarm to the System controller, which can then output the appropriate notifications.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>

When this occurs among multiple MAS mounted on the same structure or otherwise in close proximity, the System Controller or a MAS devices peer-to-peer collaboration scheme can be configured to consolidate these alarm events into a single notification.</li> <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0100">Alarm Summing by Multiple MAS Devices: MAS devices mounted on different store fixtures in the same vicinity each detecting touches at or below <figure-callout id="1" label="Type" filenames="US20190088096A1-20190321-D00004.png,US20190088096A1-20190321-D00006.png" state="{{state}}">Type</figure-callout> 1 alarm levels might collectively be identified as constituting a <figure-callout id="2" label="Type" filenames="US20190088096A1-20190321-D00004.png,US20190088096A1-20190321-D00006.png" state="{{state}}">Type</figure-callout> 2 alarm since this activity may indicate a sly sweeper removing merchandise from different fixtures to avoid detection.</li> <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0101">Broad Multi-Alarm Auto-Disable: Certain events, such as an earthquake, a subway passing nearby, or a heavy forklift on a flexible floor, can trigger alarms on many or even all MAS in a store. The System Controller or a MAS devices peer-to-peer collaboration scheme can be configured to identify this as a special event that results in a special consolidated notification or no notifications.</li> <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0102">Video System Integration Functions: Integrating with a store Video Management System (VMS) enables the MAS System Controller to notify the VMS of alarm incidences. This can result in the following response behaviors: A camera can automatically direct its focus to the location at which the alarm is occurring, permitting fewer cameras in the store to more efficiently monitor events of interest; The video related to the event can be viewed in real time by a remote person or pushed directly to a mobile device carried by personnel in the store, who can then assess the situation and determine what actions, if any, should be taken; or a smart VMS now directed by MAS to the event of interest may use analytics to detect sweep events and certain other events of interest, which can then result in an escalated notification or other actions.</li> <li id="ul0004-0007" num="0103">Stocking Disable: A potential disadvantage of the MAS method of sensing merchandise movement is the difficulty of differentiating legitimate stocking activity from sweep activity (though this is less of a challenge with merchandise pushers, as noted previously). Methods to address this issue include:
        <ul> <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0104">Store Hours Alarm Filter: During closed hours when a great deal of stocking occurs, the MAS devices and/or the System Controller notifications are automatically disabled;</li> <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0105">Manual Disable Command: Using a mobile communication device, a computer, or other device communicating with the system Controller and/or a MAS device, an authorized store team member can temporarily disable alarm Notifications originating from one or more MAS devices or the entire system. This can involve manual entry of information or using the mobile communication device to capture information from a bar code, QR code, NFC tag, or beacon; and</li> <li id="ul0005-0003" num="0106">Auto-Recognition of Employees: The presence of one or more store employees in the immediate vicinity of an alarming MAS can automatically disable notifications. Auto-recognition methods include: VMS recognition of the vest or hat color/pattern of team member uniforms; and Beacon or other micro-location methods detecting a device carried (e.g., smart mobility device) or worn (e.g., RFID or beacon/WiFi tag) by employees</li> </ul>
        </li> <li id="ul0004-0008" num="0107">Location Awareness: Optional location sensing (such as beacons or âWiFi Tagâ methods) enables the MAS to be aware of its location. This information can be used for determining the location of the MAS during initial set up, subsequent re-location, and alarms when in motion (i.e., when affixed to a merchandise item).</li> <li id="ul0004-0009" num="0108">Merchandise Interaction Detection: MAS activity data can also populate a database used to analyze shopper merchandise interactions. Depending on the intended use of the data, the detection algorithm may be adjusted to be more or less sensitive for defining an event of interest. For example, every merchandise touch interaction may be reported and, when correlated with Point of Sale (POS) data, can provide a view of sale conversion relative to merchandise interaction.</li> <li id="ul0004-0010" num="0109">Confirmation Action: The system can provide data measuring the response effectiveness of store personnel to MAS alarm Notifications. This requires a means of determining that an employee went to the location of the alarm within a reasonable amount of time after the Notification. The method may be as simple as pressing a button integral or ancillary to the MAS module or similar implementations of previously described Manual Disable Command or Auto-Recognition of Employees.</li> <li id="ul0004-0011" num="0110">Summon Assistance: The MAS could be attached to the inside of a door or window such that a person desiring access or assistance could knock and the MAS would trigger the system to summon someone. For example, 3 knocks on the door or window could be interpreted by the algorithm as a valid request. This application may be helpful in the following instances:
        <ul> <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0111">Closed Hours Associate Access: Store employees arriving for work when the store is closed often have difficulty getting the attention of someone in the store to let them in, which can be dangerous during dark winter early morning hours. Knocking on the glass triggers MAS and, if the system validates that the store is closed, the store staff is notified.</li> <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0112">Receiving Door Access: Delivery drivers are often delayed at retail stores due to difficulty raising the attention of an employee to open the receiving door. Simply knocking on the door can trigger a notification summoning assistance from anywhere in the store.</li> </ul>

In both processing types, the reduction to a single alarm event may occur by communication between the MAS devices resulting in the local filtration of the alarm prior to transmission to the System Controller. In the alternative, the reduction to a single alarm event may occur by communication of the duplicate alarms to the System Controller which thereby determines if the activity threshold is met requiring further communication of the alarm event.

These fixtures require repetitive actions (e.g., twisting a knob) and/or extended actions (e.g., holding a flip door open) to obtain multiple merchandise items. Exceeding a âdispenseâ threshold, which may be detected using vibration sensors, position sensors, switch contacts, and other sensors with appropriate algorithms, can constitute an EOI.</li> <li id="ul0012-0005" num="0158">Infrared curtains, 3D cameras, and smart video systems are capable of detecting hands entering and leaving a monitored merchandise area and, in some cases, are able to determine if merchandise is actually removed and/or replaced.

    <li> <para-num num="[0160]"> </para-num> <div id="p-0120" num="0160" class="description-line">Presence: The act of one or more persons remaining in a monitored area of interest for a period exceeding that of a typical shopper can be a suspicious event. Presence sensors utilized throughout the retail environment may be employed to detect the presence of potential persons of interest. Typical location types and methods of detecting such presence include:
</div> </li> <ul> <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0161">Isolated Location: It is suspicious when a person remains longer than usual in an area known to be favored by thieves seeking to covertly strip alarm tags from merchandise and/or stage merchandise for subsequent removal. The most common methods to detect this presence include smart video camera systems (able to detect a person and determine how long that person remains in the prescribed area) and strategically located passive infrared detection devices focused on the area of interest. Post detection algorithms determine when an EOI is declared.</li> <li id="ul0014-0002" num="0162">Fitting Rooms: A person remaining in a fitting room longer than a typical shopping visit (sometimes factoring in the quantity of garments known to be taken into the fitting room) can constitute a suspicious event. The privacy of fitting rooms is often used to strip alarm tags and conceal merchandise for subsequent removal from the store. Methods detecting the length of occupancy in fitting rooms include passive infrared detectors, switch contacts associated with door locks, sensing floor mats, and video cameras tracking entry and exit from outside the fitting room. Appropriate algorithms can declare an EOI with any of these sensing methods.</li> <li id="ul0014-0003" num="0163">Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS) Alarms: EAS tags placed on or in merchandise is normally removed or disabled during the purchasing process. A tag that has not been deactivated triggers an alarm as it passes detectors (pedestals) typically located at exit doors. Every EAS alarm is considered an EOI; those EAS systems in which store personnel are able to immediately confirm the reason for the alarm (test, missed removal of tag, theft recovery, runaway shoplifter, runaway booster team, etc.) provide additional EOI declaration confirmation.</li> <li id="ul0014-0004" num="0164">Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Tags: RFID tags are increasingly embedded in or attached to merchandise sold in retail stores. Unlike EAS tags, each RFID tag is uniquely identified to facilitate tracking that specific piece of merchandise throughout the supply chain and beyond. Using one or more RFID sensors, an excessive quantity of merchandise removed from a display fixture or taken to a location (such as a fitting room or obscure area known to be used for tag stripping) may be the basis for an EOI.</li> <li id="ul0014-0005" num="0165">Exit Doors: Various points of egress including emergency exits, receiving doors, and even trash portals are used by thieves to remove merchandise. Methods used to declare a door opening as unauthorized, and therefore an EOI, include switch contacts at emergency doors and key or code-entry exits at docks and other doors intended for use only by authorized personnel.</li> <li id="ul0014-0006" num="0166">Human Observation: While many events are detected by sensing devices, the invention also accepts event reports initiated or confirmed by store staff. For example, a store associate discovering stripped tags in a fitting room could use a mobile smart device or other method to provide event type, location, and approximate time of the incident. Another example, a suspected merchandise boosting event detected by a vibration sensor can subsequently be confirmed with certainty by store personnel. In the first case, the human input caused an EOI to be declared while the second provided certainty of the EOI.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>

    <li> <para-num num="[0167]"> </para-num> <div id="p-0121" num="0167" class="description-line">Person Identification:</div>
    </li> <li> <para-num num="[0168]"> </para-num> <div id="p-0122" num="0168" class="description-line">For purposes of the invention, âidentificationâ does not inherently mean establishing the actual identity (e.g., name) of a person. Rather, it is assigning to a given person a trackable alias (e.g., a unique alphanumeric code) based on the detection of one or more identification markers associated with that person. This alias provides the means for trending data analysis across multiple store visits relevant to a given individual. Identification markers and methods used to detect them include:
</div> </li> <ul> <li id="ul0015-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0016-0001" num="0169">Facial Recognition: The ability of smart video systems to uniquely identify a person is well known and can be implemented at store entrances/exits as well as at various locations within a store. Cameras can even be integrated directly with or immediately adjacent to EOI-detecting sensors. Such close proximity has the benefit of linking EOF s only to persons in the immediate vicinity of the EOI or even definitively involved with the actions triggering the EOI. Significantly reducing the population of persons linked to the EOI in this fashion greatly speeds the ability to firmly declare POI.</li> <li id="ul0016-0002" num="0170">Cell Phone: Since nearly everyone carries one or more cell phones, the invention can use the unique identifiers transmitted by cell phones to infer the identification of the person carrying it. Methods to identify cell phones include:
        <ul> <li id="ul0017-0001" num="0171">MAC Address: Every such wireless device is assigned a unique MAC address not duplicated in any other device anywhere. This address can often be harvested through the device&#39;s Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connectivity using a âsnifferâ designed for this purpose. One or more sniffers can be installed to harvest addresses across a relatively broad area (such as a sales floor) or at a traffic constriction point (such as an entrance or exit). For example, sniffing MAC addresses at a store exit can provide a very tight linkage between an EAS alarm EOI and a person (carrying that phone) passing through the door at that time.</li> <li id="ul0017-0002" num="0172">Beacon Interaction: Many stores offer helpful applications for shoppers to use in their stores. These applications sometimes use beacons (small radio transmitters placed at various locations in the store) to provide micro location-dependent functionality. The ability to then associate a cell phone with a position known to be near a detected EOI provides yet another opportunity for identification and close coupling of the person carrying the phone with an EOI.</li> </ul>
        </li> <li id="ul0016-0003" num="0173">RFID Tags: As noted previously, RFID tags are increasingly embedded in merchandise for use throughout the supply chain and beyond (e.g., for warranty purposes). These tags are not disabled at the purchase point and typically remain active in shoes, clothing or other items worn or carried by a person. Using RFID readers at doors or other locations in a store, the invention can use these tags as an identification marker.</li> <li id="ul0016-0004" num="0174">License Plate Recognition: Video analytics can capture license plate numbers from vehicles entering and/or leaving the facility parking lot. This vehicle identification can then be linked to an EOI occurring coincident with the vehicle&#39;s presence in the parking lot and, through statistical coincidental association, that vehicle could be linked to one or more persons identified through one of the above methods.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>

The invention provides a highly configurable mechanism for defining both the contents and range of the Threat Characterization Code (TCC) linked to each POI. By example, a typical code may comprise three alphanumeric fields, each of which provides the following characterizations or quantifications:
</div> </li> <ul> <li id="ul0021-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0022-0001" num="0187">Financial Impact: Based on actual or estimated value of the loss by this POI per incident and the quantity or frequency of incidents. The resulting code for this impact may be based on such metrics as:

        </li> <li id="ul0022-0002" num="0190">Identification Confidence: Since some identification methods are undeniably unique to the individual (like facial recognition) while others are by inference (like cell phone addresses), confidence in POI identification can shape the response strategy of loss prevention professionals.</li> <li id="ul0022-0003" num="0191">Modus Operandi: Response actions will be quite different if the POI is a suspected booster team member vs. a habitual cosmetics shoplifter. This âfieldâ provides information on historical detected modus operandi of the POI. This information often expands beyond a field to reveal other historical traits of the POI such as type of merchandise suspected of stealing and dwell locations used in the past.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>

These notifications typically include a just-detected EOI (if any) and/or the presence of a POI together with that POI&#39;s TCC. Delivery of such notifications is via known communication devices including telephones, smart wireless devices, computers, electronic tablets, pagers, and radios and are typically triggered in one of two basic situations:
        <ul> <li id="ul0026-0001" num="0195">Reactive Notifications: Sent when an EOI has been detected with a POI in the vicinity. This requires loss prevention personnel to implement a response action recognizing an incident is already in progress.</li> <li id="ul0026-0002" num="0196">Proactive Notifications: Sent when a POI is detected in the vicinity but not necessarily with a corresponding EOI.

        </li> <li id="ul0025-0002" num="0197">Testimonial Data Harvesting: Since the declaration of a person as a POI is inherently related to a series of incidents, the invention generates reports detailing the EOI related to the POI. This includes what are often highly repetitive modus operandi behaviors and permit ready linkage to videos that further detail incidents involving the POI. When a POI is apprehended, this information provides powerful evidence of a pattern of behavior extending well beyond the singular incident for which the POI was finally charged.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>

A store employee responding to the EAS alarm uses the EAS Alarm Confirmation Panel to confirm alarm validity and indicates cause as a suspected booster team.

This device consists of several key features including a housing, sensing technology, local audio capabilities, and visual cues. The housing is identifiable as a dome video surveillance camera, of a type typically mounted to a ceiling, or to a pole hanging from the ceiling wherein the system operates within a âdummy domeâ camera or equally well integrated into the housing of a real camera. The sensing technology is capable of detecting shopper behaviors, such as dwelling in an area of interest, product removal from shelves, and doors being opened.</div>

The invention will also operate equally well integrated into a housing of a real video dome camera. The SmartDome further consists of sensing technology capable of detecting real time shopper behaviors using one or more of the following: presence of one or more persons in an area of interest; actual or probable product removal from shelves; and door opening. Another key feature is local audio in the form of one or more sound effects, including voice, to draw attention to the camera when it has âgone activeâ due to detected suspicious activity and the ability to âescalateâ audio notification based on perceived risk level. Visual cues such as steady or flashing lights, which may be multi-colored, for example, blue, green, yellow or red, provide one or more of the following functionality: to visually indicate the camera has gone active; to attract the attention of the thief to look at the camera; to quickly allow store personnel, by observing the device(s) from a distance, to physically locate the zone of suspicious activity and/or the location of shoppers to whom they may offer service; to indicate level or risk or other activity based on color and/or flashing rate of lights; and to infer a direction of interest from the camera&#39;s perspective based on detected activity. An optional embodiment integrates into a system capable of notifying store personnel of detected events via various communications devices such as radios, public address systems, and mobile devices.</div>

This sound and light also gain the attention of nearby store personnel; SmartDome may also proactively notify store personnel to respond to the area via various communication channels (such as the public address system, pagers, radios, or mobile devices etc.); additionally, a SmartDome imitation camera can notify the store&#39;s Video Management System (VMS) of suspicious activity, which can trigger the VMS or the personnel monitoring the VMS to investigate by directing a nearby real PTZ camera to the area of suspicious activity, effectively increasing the monitored range and direction of real cameras at a far lower cost than a plethora of such cameras. These attention-getting features and the actual or possible response of store personnel fundamentally alters the perceived risk of detection and apprehension associated with the camera, making SmartDome significantly more effective at deterring theft than conventional cameras.</div>

It does this by using its lights, sound, and notification capabilities to indicate the presence of one or more persons in the monitored area. By placing a SmartDome above every service-intensive area in a store, personnel can quickly determine the presence of shoppers in those areas by simply observing which SmartDomes are indicating such presence. This function typically activates green lights on SmartDome. If SmartDome is also receiving triggers from devices monitoring merchandise movement on nearby shelves, this information can be used to escalate store personnel awareness of shopper&#39;s active interest (by turning the SmartDome lights from green to yellow, for example, or even triggering a notification through various communication channels). Even when used to promote customer engagement, the device remains able to provide loss prevention benefits by drawing the attention of prospective thieves and by escalated audio and light (such as flashing red lights) when suspicious activity, such as possible merchandise sweep activity, is detected.</div>

Conversely, detection of persons in multiple disparate sectors, indicating a number of shoppers in the area (a situation not as conducive to theft activity), could be the basis to not trigger escalated actions based on dwell alone (as would be the case with Type 1A or if it was likely that only one person was detected in the area);</li> <li id="ul0032-0002" num="0229">When so configured, when presence is detected in only one sector, the invention illuminates that portion of a ring of lights located on the base of the dome or inside of the dome corresponding to the direction of detected activity. As presence detection moves from one detection sector to an adjacent sector, SmartDome smoothly transitions the associated lighting based on relative detection levels from each sensor. This apparent tracking heightens the assessed risk level by a thief, providing yet another deterrence incentive.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>

    <heading id="h-0021">Activation Filtering to Maximize the Deterrent Effect and Minimize Impact to the Customer Experience</heading>
    <li> <para-num num="[0239]"> </para-num> <div id="p-0151" num="0239" class="description-line">The effectiveness of any anti-theft or theft deterrent device is predicated on its ability to responds to events that represent bona-fide suspicious behaviors. Devices that unintelligently or indiscriminately activate prove to be both ineffective at deterring theft and perhaps more importantly, have a very negative effect on the customer experience. It is a general rule in retail the any anti-theft device should not inconvenience 99% of shoppers who are legitimate, to prevent theft from the 1% of shoppers who are bad actors. In addition, store associates must embrace the technology deployed in store. They cannot be annoyed by the device activating unnecessarily when they are simply going about their daily tasks or they will find a way to disable or maliciously destroy the device. This invention employs a number of novel filtering and arming and disarming techniques that significantly enhance the effectiveness of the deterrent effect while also providing a comfortable experience for both legitimate shoppers and store associates alike. It&#39;s important to understand that maintaining a comfortable customer experience is a critical, market driven feature of this invention. The following features provide these filtering effects and each feature can be individually be activated or deactivated.
</div> </li> <ul> <li id="ul0035-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0036-0001" num="0240">1) Walk through filtering; This filtering technique requires a programmable amount of dwell period to elapse before an activation occurs. This feature allows shoppers to pass through an aisle without activating the device. Only those shoppers who dwell in front of merchandise will activate the deterrent.</li> <li id="ul0036-0002" num="0241">2) Hold Off Period: Following an activation, a hold off period is initiated where activations are suppressed for a programmable period of time. This feature is designed to avoid the device activating too frequently during busy hours of the stores. If an activation has just occurred, there is no need to immediately reactivate if presumably the same shopper remains in the detection zone.</li> <li id="ul0036-0003" num="0242">3) Intelligent Rearm: In addition to a hold off period, the invention is also capable of suppressing additional activations until the detection zone is void of customers for a period of time. This feature disarms and then rearms the detection device only when an aisle is clear. This feature is used to suppress unnecessary activations while the same shopper remains in the area and rearms the device only when a new shopper enters the area and dwells in front of merchandise of interest.</li> <li id="ul0036-0004" num="0243">4) Adjustable configuration based on time of day or day of week: The ability to set any filtering parameter based on time of day or day of week or both. This feature allows any of the activation filtering techniques to be altered based on time of day and/or day of week. This feature is used to tune the behavior of the device to the predictable and time specific traffic patterns and stocking patterns of the store to avoid unwanted activations.</li> <li id="ul0036-0005" num="0244">5) Remote Disable: During times when store associates are stocking shelves, an authorized individual can remotely suppress activations to avoid irritating and unnecessary activation during merchandise stocking periods. This feature is important to allow store associates to embrace the technology and not maliciously damage or disable the device to stop it from unnecessarily activating. Malicious damage of poorly designed anti-theft devices is not unusual in a retail environment.</li> <li id="ul0036-0006" num="0245">6) Adjustable configuration based on external data inputs: The ability to set any filtering parameter based on external data inputs such as listed below or other external characteristics. This feature allows any of the activation filtering techniques to be altered based on these parameters. Once a trigger is received, the invention evaluates recent alarm activity and various environmental factors to determine what, if any, alarm or staff notification will be issued. These environmental factors may include one or more of the following:
        <ul> <li id="ul0037-0001" num="0246">a. Store Traffic/Occupancy: The store&#39;s traffic monitoring system provides real time information on the quantity of persons entering and exiting the store, providing a means of determining the approximate quantity of people in the store at a given time;</li> <li id="ul0037-0002" num="0247">b. Staffing Level by Skillset: The store&#39;s time clock system provides information on the quantity of employees by skillset available in the store at a given time;</li> <li id="ul0037-0003" num="0248">c. Facial Recognition: The store&#39;s facial recognition system (typically of persons entering the store) can provide notification of the presence of known or suspected high risk individuals;</li> <li id="ul0037-0004" num="0249">d. Mobile Device Recognition: Mobile devices previously detected and associated with suspicious activity in this or other stores indicate the presence of suspected high risk individuals;</li> <li id="ul0037-0005" num="0250">e. License Plate Recognition: Vehicle plates associated with known or suspected high risk individuals or groups entering the store&#39;s parking lot;</li> <li id="ul0037-0006" num="0251">f. Regional Activity: Real time sharing of detected theft activity among stores in a geographical area (this may include facial and/or license plate recognition information or may simply be limited to activity related to events of interest, such as likely ORC sweep events);</li> <li id="ul0037-0007" num="0252">g. Event Correlation: Receipt of triggers of other relevant events within a reasonable time proximity; for example, separate nearby merchandise movements that might collectively represent theft sweep activity;</li> <li id="ul0037-0008" num="0253">h. Response Compliance: Some systems incorporate a means of confirming response by store personnel to a detected event; for example, a notification of a sweep event may be sent to store personnel who, upon responding to the area, press a button in that area or are otherwise confirmed to have responded within a reasonable time;</li> <li id="ul0037-0009" num="0254">i. Time of Day/Week/Year: Each of these three timing factors may be taken into account by the invention;</li> <li id="ul0037-0010" num="0255">j. Manual Adjustment: Based on observation or other factors, a manager or other authorized person can direct the invention to increase or decrease the level of aggressiveness of notifications using, for example, a mobile device application or a dedicated infrared control fob.

    <li> <para-num num="[0256]"> </para-num> <div id="p-0152" num="0256" class="description-line">The invention has a number of ways to increase the aggressiveness of the deterrent response based on the sensor inputs which can assess the threat level sensed. The device can activate mild deterrents when the threat level is mild, and can deploy more aggressive responses as the sensed threat level increases. It can also deliver multiple messages of varying aggressiveness while a shopper continues to dwell in areas of interest. These features are designed to thwart opportunistic shoplifters who are deterred by a mild deterrent as well as professional thieves who need more aggressive responses to abandon their theft. In addition to tailoring the response to the threat, the invention can also optimize for the customer experience. By minimizing the aggressiveness of the response when the sensed risk is low, the impact to legitimate shoppers is also minimized. This escalation can be accomplished in one or more of the following ways:

<br/>
PTZ Aiming: A novel feature of the invention is automatic aiming of a real or visible dummy
<br/>
PTZ camera based on the location of the event of interest. Several methods may be used to accomplish this function:
</li> <li id="ul0039-0007" num="0264">Integral Motion Sensors: This uses the multiple sensor scheme described for âType 1Bâ above. Motion exceeding the dwell time in a single detection segment or adjacent segments causes the camera to orient toward that segment (or a ratio between the two segments) and, should the motion subsequently move to an adjacent segment, to track to that segment to appear to follow the subject. Logic continuously evaluates detection across all segments to provide the most appropriate and natural camera movement.</li> <li id="ul0039-0008" num="0265">External Detectors: Primarily for â<figure-callout id="2" label="Type" filenames="US20190088096A1-20190321-D00004.png,US20190088096A1-20190321-D00006.png" state="{{state}}">Type</figure-callout> 2â Merchandise Interaction detection applications, when a qualified event is detected by an external detector (such as a vibration sensor on a shelf unit), the camera orients such that the lens points toward the location of the detected event. Some of the methods which could be used for accomplishing this include:
        <ul> <li id="ul0041-0001" num="0266">Manual Orientation &amp; Trigger: While in programming mode, the PTZ camera is manually positioned (either directly or by manual command through a wireless device) toward the location of the shelf; the sensor on that shelf is then activated to associate that camera position with that sensor. The camera can thus be configured to align to several nearby sensor locations, enabling it to point to any of these locations as needed.</li> <li id="ul0041-0002" num="0267">Radial Point Entry: Azimuth and elevation of the camera can be manually entered (such as through an infrared keypad or other programming device), then associated with an event detector (by manually entering the sensor identification number or by activating the sensor associated with that manually entered location).</li> <li id="ul0041-0003" num="0268">Laser Pointer Orientation: While in programming mode, a laser pointer is aimed at the device; sensors in the device detect the laser&#39;s azimuth and elevation, causing the PTZ to orient toward that location, at which time the sensor identification is associated with that setting using manual entry or sensor triggering.</li> <li id="ul0041-0004" num="0269">Segmented Motion Sensor Alignment: Using the motion sensors described for the <figure-callout id="1" label="Type" filenames="US20190088096A1-20190321-D00004.png,US20190088096A1-20190321-D00006.png" state="{{state}}">Type</figure-callout> 1 application, with the device in programming mode, a person stands at the sensor location until the PTZ tracks to that segment, at which time the merchandise interaction sensor is associated to that setting using manual entry or triggering.</li> </ul>

The variability in actions by the device and store personnel injects a degree of uncertainty into a thief&#39;s understanding which, in itself, creates deterrence since risk level becomes difficult to assess. For example, a SmartDome in a high value merchandise area (such as razor blades or baby formula) can be triggered by MAS devices mounted to the fixtures holding these merchandise items. In these locations, which are often plundered by shoplifters (taking one or two items) and professional sweepers (seeking to remove dozens of items), multiple actions may be taken by SmartDome depending on detected activity:
