     Devices, system, and method of vehicular multiple-link wireless communication. A vehicular communication bonding unit creates a bonded wireless communication connection that transports data-packets of a source data-stream from a remote server to a vehicular transceiver, by transporting the data-packets over at least two wireless communication links. The vehicular communication bonding unit utilizes a vehicular cellular transceiver to receive a first batch of the data-packets over a first cellular communication link that connects between the vehicular cellular transceiver and the remote server. The vehicular communication bonding unit further utilizes least one end-user device, of an occupant of a vehicle, to receive a second batch of the data-packets of the particular data-stream, over a second cellular communication link that connects between the end-user device and the remote server.

    </li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div id="p-0013" num="0012" class="description-line">The Applicants have realized that many mobile devices operating on standard communication networks, such as cellular networks, Wi-Fi networks, satellite networks, IoT networks, V2X (Vehicle to Anything) networks or wire lines (e.g., utilizing cable modems, fiber, DSL, ADSL, xDSL), are limited in the geographical areas in which they have coverage (or âreceptionâ) from their network operator, and/or in their actual or effective download/upload rate(s). In addition, even in areas wherein the mobile device has relatively good service, a typical transmission rate, or âgoodputâ or good-put or bandwidth or throughput, or Quality of Service or Quality of Experience or their equivalent measures, to or from the mobile device, may not be sufficient for the desired applications or experiences that the user, or vehicle, or service provider wants to utilize, manually or automatically and/or autonomously.</div>
    </li> <li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div id="p-0014" num="0013" class="description-line">The Applicants have further realized that these problems may be aggravated in transportation or while the device is being utilized within a moving car or vehicle. For example, In non-mass transportation, such as vehicular, motorcycles, drones, or the like, passengers such as the family children riding in the car may require more and more bandwidth for their mobile devices and applications, such as for the purposes of watching video, or transmitting (or sharing) video clips of themselves or of the surrounding, including High Definition (HD) video, 3D video, 360 degrees video, Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), immersive media content or other rich-media content. The vehicle itself or related applications or software modules may require or may prefer to be connected to the Internet with sufficient broadband goodput (or throughput) for their own operation, management, maintenance and monitoring, and/or for various vehicular applications (e.g., vehicular route guidance, vehicular mapping, remote or Over-The-Air upgrades, handling the vehicle by a remote handler or driver, or the like); particularly in a âConnected Carâ type of vehicle, the autonomous car or vehicle (of any level of autonomy such as in accordance with a five-level model of autonomy or other models), or in an Internet-of-Things (IoT) type of vehicle or vehicle-carried equipment.</div>
    </li> <li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div id="p-0015" num="0014" class="description-line">The Applicants have also realized that in mass transportation or public transportation, such as in a bus, train, subway, shuttle, ferryboat, or the like, these problems are further aggravated by the multitude of commuters that share the same vehicle. In some cases, the available bandwidth is even further limited by Radio Frequency (RF) phenomena such as reflections or fading, or cross interference among multiple transceivers of multiple devices, or by congestion or cell congestion, or by congested traffic, or failures of certain cellular infrastructure segments, or terror attacks, or weather conditions, or other factors.</div>
    </li> <li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div id="p-0016" num="0015" class="description-line">The Applicants have realized that some vehicles or vehicle-carried equipment may be equipped with a cellular modem or cellular transceiver, or satellite modem or terminal, or V2V or V2X transceivers, or IoT transceivers either from the manufacturer or from another provider along the supply chain, including after-market sources or vendors. Such conventional modem is used to provide communications for the car&#39;s own applications, such as remote uploading or updating of software into the car&#39;s computerized units, monitoring the car&#39;s status, placing of emergency calls, some digital services via the car media system, navigation applications, mapping applications, route guidance applications, driving or handling or assisting by a remote handler, radio, or the like. In mass transportation, some conventional systems utilize satellite connectivity (e.g., for trains), multiple cellular modems for trains, near-shore ships, or the like, or for the passenger usage.</div>
    </li> <li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div id="p-0017" num="0016" class="description-line">The Applicants have realized that broadband connection and/or reliable connection and/or high-quality connection and/or high-throughput connection may be needed even more in autonomous cars or self-driving vehicles or driver-less cars or other autonomous (or self-driving or self-operating) vehicles, ships, tractors, trucks, cars, trains, shuttles, or the like. In order to enable massive data collection from the multiplicity of sensors installed in such car or vehicle or in its vicinity, and in order to ensure the efficient analysis of collected data, a reliable broadband connection may be required; even more so if needed in real time, for example, for real-time data collection, uploading, downloading, analysis, processing, or other handling. For example, in order to perform proper, quick and reliable software upgrade to any of the autonomous vehicle processors, a reliable broadband connection, or overall QoS, may be required. Similarly, for any handling or assistance from a remote source or operator, either due to a vehicle fault or in the regular normal procedure, including driving the vehicle remotely or moving it or adjusting it in any way or any other remote intervention, the human or non-human remote handler may need a lot of data in real time, such as visual data from one or more cameras, Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) units, sensors, etc.</div>

The system of the present invention may enable reliable communications between vehicles, and between vehicles and infrastructure (V2XâVehicle to Anything), to allow specific applications or to achieve particular goals, for example, minimizing or reducing or preventing traffic accidents or traffic jams, improving traffic flow, automating parking, and/or automating the driving itself with autonomous cars. The Applicants have thus realized that within several years, many or most vehicles and even infrastructure (e.g., a crane, a cement mixer, a tractor, a storage container, or the like) may be equipped with yet another type of communications and modem (or transceiver), which may operate at a currently-unknown performance level, bandwidth, reliability level, and/or other characteristics.</div>

The systems and methods of the present invention provide such solutions.</div>
    </li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div id="p-0022" num="0021" class="description-line">In accordance with the present invention, bonded wireless communication may be produced and utilized, and/or multiple-link wireless communication may be produced and utilized. For example, a multi-link agent or a Bonding/Multi-Link Agent may be operable, in a vehicular unit or in a mobile electronic device of the driver or of one or more of the passengers of the vehicle. The bonding or multi-link agent, or a multiplicity of such agents, may operate to enable the utilization of multiple wireless communication links, each one of them contributing to at least some of the upstream transfer of packets and/or to at least some of the downstream transfer of packets, for the aggregated benefit of one particular vehicular or in-vehicle device, or for the aggregated benefit of multiple such vehicular devices or in-vehicle devices. For example, a 4G LTE cellular transceiver of a smartphone of the Driver of the vehicle, and a 3G cellular transceiver of a tablet of a Passenger in the vehicle, may be utilized to receive incoming packets of a streaming video that would be played on the vehicular multimedia system; and such received packets are transferred by these end-user devices (the smartphone, the tablet) to the vehicular multimedia system, via such Bonding/Multi-Link Agent(s) or multi-link agent(s), for example over a local WLAN or over a local Bluetooth connection; and the incoming packets are aggregated and/or re-assembled before or at the vehicular multimedia system to construct the media stream for playback. Other types of multi-link vehicular communications may be used; for example, sending and/or receiving packets of each session (or each application) via a separate or dedicated link (or set of links), and/or via a separate or dedicated modem or transceiver (or set of modems, or set of transceivers); with or without switching between (or among) links during the session; such that each such session or each such application (e.g., streaming media application; mapping application; video conference application; or the like) is using a single link at any point in time (or, a particular subset of the available links), but not necessarily the wireless or cellular link of the device itself or the equipment itself that it is running on. For example, if the modem of one passenger provides a broader bandwidth at a certain point in time (or during a particular time-slot), then the vehicle may use it for downloading software to upgrade one of its components; similar determinations or operations may be performed based on other and/or additional criteria or conditions, for example, cost of data transfer, policies, over-usage of a certain link or device, or the like.</div>

Such usage includes, for example, coordinating the communications of one or more applications of one or more of the vehicle occupants, according to the current or recent or predicted or estimated or past/historical performance (for example, at least one or more of: bandwidth, goodput, throughput, error rate, latency, jitter behavior, dropped packets, defective packets, erroneous packets, requests for retransmission of packets) over at least one of the communication links and/or over all of them combined. Other parameters that may be considered are, for example, cost of using each of the links; aggregated cost of using a particular group or batch or set of the available links; pre-defined, system-defined and/or user-defined policies; preferences of the user or the vehicle owner or the service provider or the operator or others, or information passed from or to or through one or more of the communication networks. It may also include delivering the information about the current or expected or predicted performance, and/or current or predicted demand for bandwidth or other performance by any one or all of the other applications, in an open Application Programming Interface (API) or otherwise to other applications. These applications may then use this data or predictions to decide about their own behavior, demand for bandwidth, recommendation to the user, to time or schedule their network usage level and absolute usage and utilization, to activate or de-activate certain features of the application, to increase or decrease a level Quality of Service (QoS) service provided by the application, and/or to synchronize or adjust or modify their performance demands, momentary or for a pre-defined time-slot or in a continuous manner, with the actual performance or predictions of one or more of the communication links or of the combined communication link, and even select a particular communications link or a particular set of some particular multiple links to be used or to be excluded from usage, for any period of time, or during particular time-slot(s).</div>
    </li> <li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div id="p-0024" num="0023" class="description-line">By exchanging this performance and demand information and predictions between the bonding layer and the applications that use it, the bonding layer may, for example, use it to facilitate optimization of the bonded communication, and/or of the network or multiple cellular networks performances according to data associated from the bonding devices and/or from applications (e.g., route guidance or mapping) and other navigation devices or software applications, maps, media streaming applications, fleet management devices or services, sensors in the vehicle, sensors in the environment, sensors in the passenger or passengers mobile devices, sensors in other vehicles, bonding devices in other vehicles, sensors or indicators from the network or networks, or a combination of the above.</div>

For example, the vehicle may use a passenger smartphone to download navigation maps because the momentarily available goodput on that passenger&#39;s smartphone is better or higher than that of the cellular communication device of the vehicle itself; and since this navigation map is deemed very important and/or is assigned a higher priority than infotainment applications. At the same time, the vehicle&#39;s cellular transceiver or device may be bonded with another passenger&#39;s mobile device (e.g., tablet) and they may be used to stream video into the vehicle for infotainment purposed (e.g., utilizing in parallel a 4G transceiver of a tablet of a passenger, which receives cellular packets of the streaming video, and which transmits them to the vehicular entertainment system over Bluetooth or Zigbee or WLAN or Wi-Fi).

This way, the vehicle may switch to a different cellular network, or operator, or communication technology, or communication protocol or communication standard, according to any of the suitable or relevant performance parameters or cost parameters or preferences or policies. This particular or special or separate eUSIM or IoT SIM may further be used. Optionally, to download or to transfer such credentials or log-in data to the passengers&#39; cellular devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, smart-watches) so that they can switch to and/or among cellular operators, technologies, standards and/or networks. Additionally or alternatively, one of the virtually bonded devices with its SIMs may be used as a proxy for the other devices or software modules participating in the multi-link or bonded operation; and in such case, the bonding device, or any of the participating devices, or software modules, may request to use a protocol from the other devices to download credentials of VSIM (Virtual SIM) identity or identities, from a VSIM provider. This way, one or more of the participating devices or software modules may be used as a proxy for one or more of the others to download or to obtain VSIM or similar identities or credentials to be used by such other or others to identify themselves or to sign-in to a different network or operator and to get serviced by it. The benefits are, for example, that a better or faster or increased-bandwidth service or increased-throughout service may be provided to any one or more of the cellular devices participating in such multi-link communications, because its previous service was poor or low-quality or expensive or low-bandwidth or low-throughput or not sufficient, due to one or more issues such as coverage areas of the various cellular operators, congestions in any specific cellular area or sector or tower or cell, cost issues, data excess usage, throttling or other policies, and/or any other effect that may be amplified when the vehicle is moving from one area or cellular coverage area to another. In some embodiments, changing identity or credentials, downloading new ones, connecting to an operator, disconnecting from an operator and using an eSIM or VSIM for data communication, and/or other suitable operations or changes, may be triggered by (or may be autonomously initiated by) pre-defined events or pre-defined conditions, such accidents, which may be automatically identified or detected by sensors or systems in the vehicle which are connected or commanding the bonding or multilink software, or by events or conditions such as heavy traffic, or by the need of the remote service provider to obtain more or additional information from the vehicle, or by the need to download software into a vehicular unit as quickly and reliably as possible, and/or by any other momentary or temporary trigger or need or condition; and this may be performed, in some embodiments, instead of using an extra eSIM or VSIM or operator or regular SIM or operator connectivity at all times.</div>

Such transmission may be of high importance, such as in the case of a traffic accident or a vehicular failure or a health situation of a passenger. The trigger may be from within the vehicle or from around it or external to it. As the data may be of high importance or even critical, and/or may require high bandwidth, and/or the vehicular cellular or other communication system may not be sufficient to transmit it reliably and/or quickly and/or in full, the vehicular communication system may tether into or may bond with the passenger communication device(s), or any other communication device(s) in the vehicle, and use it to transmit part or all of the information, in conjunction or simultaneously with the vehicular communication device or on its own. Such automatic tethering or bonding may be allowed or authorized or enforced by regulation or by passenger opting-in for emergency cases, either with passenger real-time approval or without it. This allows automatic emergency or high bandwidth transmission and/or reception of traffic using multiple links where the traffic is split or divided across them according to performance of each, or according to the total performance of all links, or according to the requirements of the particular application, or according to the user preferences or the networks or operators information and preferences, based on cost criteria, based on current and/or expected battery level or levels of one or more of the participating devices and the preferences of maintaining such battery levels, and/or based on regulations. For example, in case of a nearby traffic accident, the vehicle communication system may bond the passenger or passengers smartphones to start transmitting live real time video, or recorded video from just before the accident, to any remote location or multiple locations or receivers, with or without additional telemetry and vehicular related information about the status of the vehicle and/or of the passengers, such as health or biophysical related information. This may be done automatically, even in cases where the passenger is incapable of activating it or opting-in, according to pre-defined operational conditions or Artificial Intelligence (AI) decisions, regulations, or in-advance conditional opting-in, or other conditions or criteria.</div>

Such information, received from the network or networks elements or from the multilink element or from any other source (or, estimated locally buy the end-user device or by the vehicular processor), may further impact the vehicle route selection, if the user so prefers or automatically, for example if it falls under certain QoS thresholds defined by the vendor or service provider or the user or default parameters. Such route selections may apply not only to communication congestion conditions, but also to any other communication state or status; for example, under normal, not congested communications, it may be predicted that in a certain vehicle route segment (e.g., the next 6 minutes of driving), the aggregated downlink bandwidth is estimated to be less than 1 mbps, or the lowest latency at a certain reliability level is estimated to be too high (e.g., above 2 seconds of latency at 90% reliability or certainty for all aggregated links or for any specific link); while on another route segment which may be taken to reach the destination, the communication QoS or parameters are predicted or evaluated or estimated to be better or higher at a certain level or percentage or absolutely or relatively; such that the driver (human driver, or robotic/machine-based driver) may select which vehicle route to take, optionally also in view of traditional vehicle route data such as distance and duration or road traffic congestion, or such selection may be performed automatically by the vehicle, according to predefined thresholds and conditions or according to machine-learnt patterns of the driver or passenger preferences and/or the used application patterns as also may be shared from other users over time and/or at these or similar vehicle or communication route conditions. Communication congestion may pertain to any QoS or communication delivery parameter, such as uplink or downlink goodput, throughput, bandwidth, latency, error rate, jittery behavior of any such parameter, number or percentage of lost packets or defective packets or erroneous packets or missing packets or re-transmitted packets, or the like.</div>

In these applications the computing power in/of the vehicle is harnessed for other purposes, not necessarily directly related to the benefits or operation of the vehicle itself or its occupants. For example, the computing power of the vehicle, processors, memory, storage or others, may be offered or used by remote applications or users. They may be rented or leased or sold or any other business model to any application, user or service provider. These vehicle computing elements may be used as a cloud extension, cloudlets, ad-hoc extension, computer-for-lease, application running platforms, distributed computing systems. A remote cloud may use these vehicle elements when it needs more resources, when it prefers to use computing elements at the edge because they are physically closer, or IP-routed closer, to a specific source or destination or node, or less costly in terms of monetized cost or in terms of performance-related cost, or due to other reasons. In such cases the bonded communication link, of high bandwidth or goodput and/or of high reliability, may be required to download software or data into the vehicle elements, to upload the results of products or processed output from the vehicle computing elements back to the IP source or destination or node that requires them, whether one time or multiplicity of times. For example, the vehicle processing elements may be used to perform some video processing such as transcoding or overlaying or others over video data that is downloaded to it, and then return the processed video back to the cloud that ordered it. Such services can be done voluntarily or sold. In other examples, the remote element such as an application running in the cloud, may ask the vehicle processing elements to perform certain processing tasks on downloaded data and then when the vehicle arrives at a different location, or locations, to upload to other IP nodes. This may save delivery costs as the upload may be done closer to the destination, using the fact that the vehicle is moving, including to long distances such as drones or ships or trains or trucks do. It may also use knowledge of the vehicle itinerary, or schedule, or habits of driving, to plan such processing and delivery. The bonded or multilink may also be pre-coordinated according to the map of communication build by the bonding elements over time as described elsewhere in this invention or other information. In other examples, processing elements in the vehicle may be used as relays to other vehicles, or pedestrians or other processing elements in the wireless range of the vehicle movement. For example, several video streams may be downloaded into the vehicle using the bonded or multilink link, thus be done quickly over high goodput and reliably, at one point in time and location or in several scheduled or ad-hoc points in time and location. The vehicle processing elements may then broadcast or multicast these video streams, such as using ad-<figure-callout id="5G" label="hoc" filenames="US20210114616A1-20210422-D00000.png,US20210114616A1-20210422-D00004.png" state="{{state}}">hoc</figure-callout> 5G eMBMS or other on-board broadcasting method and devices. Thus it may become part of the cellular, or other, service provider network for temporary or permanent mobile usage. The bonded link may facilitate the communication from these vehicle relays or mobile elements back and forth with the network elements or the service provider elements in a shorter duration, more reliably, thus in a more mobile way, in higher efficiency, at lower cost than for example satellite link (which is hardly mobile and certainly not operating everywhere such as not in tunnels or in underground areas), with more data exchanged over shorter time periods and in more reliability when using more than single technology or operator or even when using several links of the same cellular operator because they may provide more diversity and overall more broadband and goodput than a single connection via that operator.</div>

For example, as video resolution increase, 4K video may require 16-20 mbps even with advanced codecs. There are highly communication-demanding applications forecasted for the vehicular environment. In terms of low latency, these are mostly safety related applications of connectivity by the automatic/autonomous or self-driving vehicle systems, with or towards the systems or units of other vehicle(s) or of the road infrastructures (e.g., a smart/IoT traffic light). These are mostly ad-hoc and even point-to-point, rather than having to go through the service provider infrastructure in the middle. For the rest of the applications, these ânot safetyâ ones mostly require high bandwidth and high continuity. For example, video watching or uploading (including live video from the vehicle); for the passengers&#39; infotainment; many times more than a single passenger; especially demanding are 360 degrees video, Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) video. For high-quality immersive experience, a very low latency is desired; latency below 50 ms to the Telco cloud, and latency below 100 ms to the public cloud is desired. The screens used in vehicles range from the small smartphones through tablets size and up to larger and higher definition screens, even in consumer vehicles. Video and data stream from the vehicle sensors, including cameras, LIDAR or others, in cases of emergency, accidents, etc., may similarly require high bandwidth and/or low latency. High volume software download such as updating vehicle processors (Firmware OTAâover the air updates to Firmware), may similarly require high bandwidth, but typically they may be postponed by a few minutes or a few hours. For example, in 6DoF multimedia or video or AR/VR with 6 Degrees of Freedom, the very high variability for this video format ranges between 100 Mbps at the lowest (very small devices and low latency) to 600 Mbps for larger screens and higher latency allowed. Some non-VR 4K streams require a connection of at least 25 Mbps; and some VR video stream in 4K resolution may need a 500 Mbps connection to run fluidly.</div>
