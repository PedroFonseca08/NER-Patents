     Examples are provided for traffic pole verification systems. In one example, a traffic detection system in a vehicle includes a navigation sensor, a communication system, a processor, and a storage device storing instructions executable by the processor to determine a current location information of the vehicle, obtain a referring traffic pole information based on the current location information, receive one or more of cryptographic pole data and associated cryptographic sign data via the communication system from a transmitter associated with a prospective referring traffic pole including an associated traffic sign mounted thereon; and selectively control one or more vehicle systems of the vehicle based on cryptographic verification of the prospective referring pole using the obtained referring traffic pole information; wherein the cryptographic verification of the prospective referring pole is performed after successful signature verification of the one or more of cryptographic pole data and associated cryptographic sign data.

        <span itemprop="definition">provides mechanisms for performing real-time detection and recognition of traffic poles as well as traffic lights, signals, and/or signs with robust authentication and verification of detected data to address data security. For example, in order to distinguish legitimate traffic signs from fake sign signals, such as those displayed by hacking existing traffic signal control systems, cryptography associated signal verification mechanisms may be employed. However, a challenge for the cryptography associated signal verification mechanisms, recognized by the inventors, is ambiguity in understanding which traffic pole to refer to when multiple traffic signs from multiple poles are presented (e.g., due to physical rotation of traffic poles) or when a traffic pole is removed physically thereby resulting in no traffic sign at an intersection. In some examples, aspects of the disclosure provide for a cryptography based traffic pole attack detection system that supplements cryptography based traffic sign verification systems.</span>

    <li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div id="p-0003" num="0002" class="description-line">Intelligent transportation systems (ITS), a component of the ongoing evolution of smart cities, may be used in decision making in traffic planning and traffic management. Cars, traffic lights, drivers, sensors, roadside units, and other public infrastructures form a complex networked system of systems. ITS-based applications may include optimal traffic signal control, safe intersection crossing, and emergency warning notifications, with the goals of enhancing travel efficiency, public safety, emergency response, and even disaster recovery. As the building blocks of an ITS, smart traffic lights, signals, and/or signs are increasingly used in traffic management. Some vehicles, such as autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, may utilize imaging systems to detect traffic lights, signals, and/or signs and adjust vehicle operation accordingly. The traffic infrastructure is generally complex and often includes multiple traffic poles to regulate the vehicular movements from multiple directions using singular or multiple signs.</div>

    <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div id="p-0004" num="0003" class="description-line">The disclosure provides mechanisms for performing real-time detection and recognition of traffic poles as well as traffic lights, signals, and/or signs with robust authentication and verification of detected data to address data security. For example, in order to distinguish legitimate traffic signs from fake sign signals, such as those displayed by hacking existing traffic signal control systems, cryptography associated signal verification mechanisms may be employed. However, a challenge for the cryptography associated signal verification mechanisms, recognized by the inventors, is ambiguity in understanding which traffic pole to refer to when multiple traffic signs from multiple poles are presented (e.g., due to physical rotation of traffic poles) or when a traffic pole is removed physically thereby resulting in no traffic sign at an intersection. In some examples, aspects of the disclosure provide for a cryptography based traffic pole attack detection system that supplements cryptography based traffic sign verification systems. In some of the disclosed systems, data indicating a traffic pole and data indicating a traffic sign is secured (e.g., encrypted and/or digitally signed) and transmitted to a vehicle. The vehicle verifies the secured data of the traffic pole based on a traffic pole position information obtained using a navigation system of the vehicle to check if the traffic pole transmitting the secured data refers to a lane the vehicle is travelling on. Further, the vehicle verifies the secured data of the associated traffic sign using a recognized sign from a computer vision system in order to check the authenticity of the computer vision-based recognized sign using cryptographic authentication.</div>

The addition of the advanced components into the traffic infrastructure to aid the smooth traffic management increases the complexity of the driving infrastructure which expects a clear understanding from the vehicles in order to operate the vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) based intelligent traffic management system.</div>
    </li> <li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div id="p-0020" num="0019" class="description-line">The advanced traffic infrastructure poses serious perturbation challenges to sensor based traffic sign recognition systems. The existing traffic management systems utilize complex deep learning based traffic sign recognition systems for understanding the traffic infrastructure. However, the complexity challenges are further enhanced by the security for digital systems which are used in both the vehicles and traffic infrastructure. Hence, cryptography based traffic sign recognition system may be employed to harden the existing sensor based systems. However, the physical attacks on traffic infrastructure components (e.g., traffic poles) induces changes to the overall traffic infrastructure which confuses the cryptography based systems. As an example physical world attack on the traffic infrastructure involves the displacement of the traffic sign poles by changing the directions. When a vehicle encounters two traffic poles in a single path, it creates ambiguity in understanding and planning path for the vehicles.</div>

In the trigger-based example, the system may perform a continuous and/or periodic transmission for a predetermined period of time after detecting the trigger and/or until an exit trigger is detected (e.g., the vehicle is determined to be outside of the threshold distance of the traffic sign and/or is detected as heading away from the traffic sign). Alternatively, in the trigger-based example, the system may perform a predetermined number of transmissions (e.g., one to three transmissions) responsive to the trigger and not perform any additional transmissions until a next trigger is detected. The trigger-based example may provide a highest degree of resource savings relative to the continuous and period broadcast examples by only utilizing transmission resources responsive to a trigger that indicates that a vehicle or driver may be attempting to recognize the associated traffic sign. In each of the above examples of transmission, the data may be transmitted via a wireless communication link according to an associated protocol (e.g., WIFI, WIFI direct, cellular connectivity, BLUETOOTH, Near-Field Communication [NFC], 5G, Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET) protocol, etc.). For example, the transmission may occur on a proximity-based communication link (e.g., BLUETOOTH, NFC, etc.) in order to target vehicles that are near the traffic sign. Furthermore, in each of the above examples of transmission of cryptographic sign and pole information, the cryptographic sign and pole information may be updated responsive to a change in the traffic sign signal provided by the traffic sign control system (which also causes an associated change in a display of the traffic sign). The updated cryptographic sign and pole information may correspond to an updated unique ID that corresponds to the updated traffic sign signal. In some examples, only the cryptographically represented sign ID may be updated, however the updated cryptographically represented sign ID may be transmitted along with the cryptographically represented pole ID. Similarly, when only the cryptographically represented pole ID is updated (e.g., due to installation of a new pole, a periodic pole ID update, etc.), the updated cryptographically represented pole ID is transmitted along with the cryptographically represented sign ID.
