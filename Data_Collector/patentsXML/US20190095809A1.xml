<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit under 35 USC § 119(a) of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2017-0124062 filed on Sep. 26, 2017 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Field</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The following description relates to method and apparatus for predicting a movement of a vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To control an autonomous vehicle, a speed of the autonomous vehicle and deciding whether to change lanes of the autonomous vehicle may be determined based on a movement of a nearby vehicle. To determine the movement of the nearby vehicle, information regarding the nearby vehicle, such as, for example, sensor information, directional indicator, orientation of a heading angle of the nearby vehicle, and a trajectory of the nearby vehicle may be desired to be captured. For example, when the autonomous vehicle is to drive straight, enter a left lane, or enter a right lane, a speed of the nearby vehicle and intent of the nearby vehicle to enter a left or right lane may need to be acquired. In this example, a movement of the heading angle or the directional indicator may be recognized to acquire the intent.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When the nearby vehicle suddenly changes a lane or radically reduces the speed, the autonomous vehicle has difficulty in coping with such a sudden movement of the nearby vehicle, which may lead to an accident on a road. Thus, there is a need for obtaining precise and accurate information for predicting a movement of a vehicle.</p>

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In operation <b>201</b>, a vehicle movement prediction apparatus identifies a type of the target vehicle <b>101</b> travelling in a target lane <b>103</b> on a road including at least one lane. A type of the target vehicle <b>101</b> is a category into which a vehicle is classified and includes categories, such as, for example, a bus, a taxi, and a commuter vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In an example, the vehicle movement prediction apparatus analyzes a feature of the target vehicle <b>101</b> based on information acquired using sensor or camera of the host vehicle <b>102</b>, information collected from the target vehicle <b>101</b> through short range communication, information acquired from a memory of the host vehicle <b>102</b> or an external server, or external sensor or camera.

In an example, the location information associated with the type of the target vehicle <b>101</b> is location information used for driving of the target vehicle <b>101</b> based on the type of the target vehicle <b>101</b>. For example, when the type of the target vehicle <b>101</b> is a bus, the location information includes bus-only lane information, bus route information, and bus-stop location information. The location information includes a location of the target vehicle <b>101</b>, characteristics of a road on which the target vehicle <b>101</b> is located, and information on a lane for driving of the target vehicle <b>101</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the vehicle movement prediction apparatus calculates a probability p<sub>1 </sub><b>104</b> of the target vehicle <b>101</b> going straight, a probability p<sub>2 </sub><b>105</b> of the target vehicle <b>101</b> changing lanes to the right, a probability p<sub>3 </sub><b>106</b> of the target vehicle <b>101</b> changing lanes to the left, and a probability p<sub>4 </sub><b>107</b> of the target vehicle <b>101</b> decelerating. In an example, one or more of these probabilities are calculated based on the type of the target vehicle <b>101</b> and the location information of the target vehicle <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The probability p<sub>1 </sub><b>104</b> indicates a probability of the target vehicle <b>101</b> travelling in the target lane <b>103</b> without changing lanes. The probability p<sub>2 </sub><b>105</b> indicates a probability of the target vehicle <b>101</b> changing a lane from the target lane <b>103</b> to a right lane, for example, a third lane. The probability p<sub>3 </sub><b>106</b> indicates a probability of the target vehicle <b>101</b> changing a lane from the target lane <b>103</b> to a left lane, for example, a first lane. Since the movement of the target vehicle <b>101</b> associated with the lane is classified as one of two scenarios including a lane maintenance and a lane change, a sum of the probability p<sub>1 </sub><b>104</b>, the probability p<sub>2 </sub><b>105</b>, and the probability p<sub>3 </sub><b>106</b> is “1”. The probability p<sub>4 </sub><b>107</b> is a probability associated with whether a deceleration occurs and thus, corresponds to a value between “0” and “1”.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In an example, the vehicle movement prediction apparatus generates the lane-change probability and the deceleration probability of the target vehicle <b>101</b> based on the type of the target vehicle <b>101</b> and the location information of the target vehicle <b>101</b> and predicts the movement of the target vehicle <b>101</b> based on the generated probabilities. The lane-change probability and the deceleration probability are applied to predict the movement of the target vehicle <b>101</b> and used to adjust a lane-change probability and a deceleration probability predicted in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In an example, the vehicle movement prediction apparatus identifies a host lane, for example, the first lane of the host vehicle <b>102</b> and the target lane <b>103</b> of the target vehicle <b>101</b> to control the host vehicle <b>102</b>. In an example, the vehicle movement prediction apparatus generates a target speed of the host vehicle <b>102</b> based on one or more of the target lane <b>103</b>, the host lane, the probability p<sub>1 </sub><b>104</b>, the probability p<sub>2 </sub><b>105</b>, the probability p<sub>3 </sub><b>106</b>, the probability p<sub>4 </sub><b>107</b>, a speed of the target vehicle <b>101</b>, and a speed of the host vehicle <b>102</b>. The vehicle movement prediction apparatus controls the speed of the host vehicle <b>102</b> based on the generated target speed.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In an example, the vehicle movement prediction apparatus determines whether the host vehicle <b>102</b> is to change lanes based on the target lane <b>103</b>, the host lane, the probability p<sub>1 </sub><b>104</b>, the probability p<sub>2 </sub><b>105</b>, the probability p<sub>3 </sub><b>106</b>, the probability p<sub>4 </sub><b>107</b>, a speed of the target vehicle <b>101</b>, and a speed of the host vehicle <b>102</b>. The vehicle movement prediction apparatus controls driving of the host vehicle <b>102</b> based on a result of determining whether the host vehicle <b>102</b> changes lanes.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Driving of the host vehicle <b>102</b> is controlled based on recognized information associated with, for example, a speed, a trajectory, and a direction indicator of a nearby vehicle. There may be difficulties in controlling the host vehicle when the nearby vehicle unpredictably changes lanes or suddenly decelerates. For example, when the driving of the host vehicle <b>102</b> is controlled using only the direction indicator of the nearby vehicle, a risk of collision may be relatively high because a bus or a taxi frequently changes lanes or decelerates.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In an example, the vehicle movement prediction apparatus predicts the movement of the target vehicle <b>101</b> and adjusts the lane-change probability and the deceleration probability of the target vehicle <b>101</b> based on the type of the target vehicle <b>101</b> and the location information associated with the type of the target vehicle <b>101</b>, thereby reducing a risk of accident occurring due to a sudden lane change or deceleration. The vehicle movement prediction apparatus controls the driving of the host vehicle <b>102</b> in when the target vehicle <b>101</b> suddenly changing lanes or decelerating.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The vehicle movement prediction apparatus identifies a location of a bus stop <b>304</b> at a distance from the target vehicle <b>301</b> based on the bus-stop location information.

When the type of the target vehicle is the commuter vehicle, the vehicle movement prediction apparatus determines a number of times that passengers get on and off the commuter vehicle on a road on which the target vehicle is travelling. For example, the vehicle movement prediction apparatus determines whether the road on which the target vehicle is travelling is a road in a residential area or a road having restrictions due to the presence of children and determines the number of times that passengers get on and off the commute vehicle on the road. A number of times that passengers get on and off the commute vehicle on the road in a residential area or the road with restrictions due to the presence of children may be greater than a number of times that passengers get on and off the commute vehicle on a general road or on a highway.</p>

<p id="p-0122" num="0112">The vehicle movement prediction apparatus calculates the lane-change probability using a probability model in which the lane-change probability and the deceleration probability increase according to an increase in the number of times that passengers get on and off and the lane-change probability increases according to an increase in a distance from the lane of the target vehicle <b>601</b> to the lane in which passengers get on and off the commuter vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0113">Although not shown, in an example, the vehicle movement prediction apparatus determines whether a type of a target vehicle is a garbage truck. When the type of the target vehicle is the garbage truck, the vehicle movement prediction apparatus determines a number of times that the garbage truck stops on a road on which the target vehicle is travelling. For example, the vehicle movement prediction apparatus determines whether the road is a road in a residential area or a road in a commercial area and determines the number of times the garbage truck may stop. A number of times that the garbage truck stops on the residential area or the road in a commercial area may be greater than a number of times that the garbage truck stops on a general road or on a highway.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0114">The vehicle movement prediction apparatus identifies a target lane of the target vehicle on the road and determines a lane-change direction of the garbage truck stopping based on the identified target lane. The vehicle movement prediction apparatus generates a lane-change probability corresponding to the lane-change direction based on the number of times that the garbage truck stops on the road and the target lane. The vehicle movement prediction apparatus generates a deceleration probability of the target vehicle based on the number of times that the garbage truck stops on the road.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0115">The vehicle movement prediction apparatus calculates the lane-change probability using a probability model in which the lane-change probability and the deceleration probability increase according to an increase in the number of times that the garbage truck stops on the road and the lane-change probability increases according to an increase in a distance from the target lane to a lane in which the garbage truck stops.</p>

To determine the movement of the nearby vehicle, information regarding the nearby vehicle, such as, for example, sensor information, directional indicator, orientation of a heading angle of the nearby vehicle, and a trajectory of the nearby vehicle may be desired to be captured. For example, when the autonomous vehicle is to drive straight, enter a left lane, or enter a right lane, a speed of the nearby vehicle and intent of the nearby vehicle to enter a left or right lane may need to be acquired. In this example, a movement of the heading angle or the directional indicator may be recognized to acquire the intent.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>
