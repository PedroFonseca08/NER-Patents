<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Unless otherwise indicated herein, the approaches described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Digital radiography is a form of X-ray imaging in which digital X-ray imaging detectors are used to generate digital X-ray images, and has multiple advantages over traditional film-based techniques. By bypassing chemical processing, digital radiography is more time efficient, provides digital images for immediate image preview, facilitates image enhancement, and generally requires less radiation to produce an image of similar contrast.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Digital radiography is now used in many applications, including medical diagnostics, veterinary care, dental imaging, industrial inspection, and security. Each of these applications could benefit from a completely portable implementation of an X-ray acquisition system, i.e., battery-powered device with full image acquisition, enhancement, and data storage capabilities. However, the power requirements of conventional digital X-ray devices preclude such a completely portable device. For example, while X-ray imaging detectors have been developed with a form factor that can be easily carried, the size and power requirements of the associated image acquisition work station generally prevents such a system from being implemented as a single self-contained, battery powered device. Instead, in conjunction with an X-ray imaging detector, a dedicated computer workstation is typically employed for receiving acquired images, performing image processing and enhancement, and providing a user interface for controlling image acquisition.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the disclosure, as generally described herein, and illustrated in the figures, can be arranged, substituted, combined, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are explicitly contemplated and make part of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In light of the description of the prior art above, there is a need in the art for a portable X-ray digital imaging apparatus that is battery powered and includes user interface, image acquisition, image enhancement, data storage and data transmission capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to embodiments of the present disclosure, an imaging detector is configured to download study data from one or more external servers, generate a digital representation of an x-ray image, and associate the digital representation to the study data.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, according to embodiments of the present disclosure, a digital X-ray image is generated via a portable, battery-powered, X-ray sensor system, and made available to a user via a user's computing device, such as a smartphone, laptop computer, or electronic tablet. The X-ray sensor system is configured to perform image processing and the user's computing device displays a user interface (UI) for interacting with the X-ray system. Consequently, the functionality of a conventional radiographic X-ray acquisition system is provided without an external data acquisition and processing workstation. Furthermore, the X-ray sensor system has a power state architecture that can significantly reduce power consumption, thereby enabling use of the X-ray system as a portable, battery-powered device. Specifically, the X-ray system is configured with a first power region that performs image acquisition and a second power region that performs UI, networking, and image processing functions. To save power, the processor associated with the first power region and the processor associated with the second power region can each independently enter a lower power consumption state, such as an idle state or a sleep state.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a digital radiographic X-ray acquisition system <b>100</b>, according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure. Digital radiographic X-ray acquisition system <b>100</b> is a digital radiography system that is configured to provide the functionality of a conventional radiographic X-ray acquisition system when paired with a user computing device. Thus, in addition to generating raw digital X-ray image data based on incident X-rays, digital radiographic X-ray acquisition system <b>100</b> is also configured to generate digital images based on the raw digital X-ray image data, perform suitable image processing of the digital images, and provide a UI that enables a user to access the digital images without a dedicated data acquisition workstation or other computing device. As shown, digital radiographic X-ray acquisition system <b>100</b> includes a user access device <b>110</b> wirelessly connected to an X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b>, which in turn can connect to remote servers (external server) <b>140</b> via a network <b>105</b>. In some embodiments, digital radiographic X-ray acquisition system <b>100</b> connects to remote servers <b>140</b> via a wireless access point <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Network <b>105</b> may be any technically feasible type of communications network that allows data to be exchanged between digital radiographic X-ray acquisition system <b>100</b> and remote servers <b>140</b>. Examples of network <b>105</b> may include a wide area network (WAN), a local area network (LAN), a wireless (e.g., WiFi) network, and/or the Internet, among others.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Remote servers <b>140</b> are computing devices in which resides information pertinent to operation of X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b>, such as user data, patient data, previously performed studies, and previously acquired images associated therewith. For example, in some embodiments, remote servers <b>140</b> include one or more Digital Image and Communications in Medicine (DICOM&#xae;) servers, such as a DICOM&#xae; picture archiving and communication system (PACS) storage server and/or a DICOM&#xae; PACS review workstation. Such servers provide storage and convenient access to medical images from multiple modalities, thereby enabling a user of X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> to immediately access previously generated medical images and/or studies associated with a particular patient or project. In other examples, the servers provide storage and convenient access to other X-ray images used in industrial and security applications.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">User access device <b>110</b> may be any technically feasible computing device that includes a display device <b>111</b> for displaying a UI and is capable of wirelessly connecting to X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b>. For example, user access device <b>110</b> may be a smartphone and/or a wearable computing device, an electronic tablet, a laptop computer, and the like, that is configured to interact with (e.g., receive output from and provide input to) X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, user access device <b>110</b> is programmed with a software application that enables such interactions with X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b>. A user access device <b>110</b> may enables such interactions, so X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> does not require a dedicated data acquisition workstation, such as a desktop computer. As a result, X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> can be configured in a more portable form factor. In addition, the power usage associated with a display device is externalized to user access device <b>110</b>, further enhancing the portability of X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> and duration of the operating time for X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, user access device <b>110</b> interacts with X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> via a web-browser-based interface. In such embodiments, X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> is configured as a web server that transmits a UI to user access device <b>110</b> during operation of X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b>. Furthermore, in such embodiments, to interact with X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b>, user access device <b>110</b> may be any computing device that supports a suitable browser program, for example a Hypertext Markup Language-5-compliant (HTML5-compliant) Web browser program. Thus, X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> can operate according to a &#x201c;bring your own device&#x201d; scheme, and therefore can be operated by a plurality of different users, each with a different user access device <b>110</b>. As a result, the impact of repairing or completely replacing software executed by X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> on the plurality of different users is greatly reduced, since each of the individual user access devices <b>110</b> is unaffected by such upgrades or repairs. In addition, such software upgrades are streamlined, since upgrades to each of the various user access devices <b>110</b> is not required.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> is a battery powered, wireless radiographic panel that is configured with the functionality of an X-ray image acquisition workstation in the form factor of a portable X-ray imaging detector. As such, capabilities of X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> include, without limitation, one or more of: image processing capability for radiographic (single image X-ray) applications; image processing capability for fluoroscopic (video X-ray) applications; querying over a wireless network, such as network <b>105</b>, downloading or uploading study data from the remote server, such as a DICOM&#xae; Modality Worklist Server included in remote servers <b>140</b>; locally storing study data to be performed, similar to a DICOM&#xae; Modality Worklist Server, which can be dynamically synchronized with one or more of remote servers <b>140</b>; providing a user interface, via an internal Web server, to access a locally stored study data in a database or electronic storage device (e.g., flash memory); maintaining a local record of studies performed and images acquired, such as a panel-resident version of a DICOM&#xae; PACS; providing a user interface to view and/or review such studies; transmitting studies performed, including images, directly from X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> to one or more of remote servers <b>140</b>; the ability to be simultaneously connected to both user access device <b>110</b> and to network-resident resources residing in one or more of remote servers <b>140</b>; and the ability to undergo software repair or replacement without the need for a separate computing device, such as a dedicated workstation computer. In addition, in some embodiments, capabilities of X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> include, without limitation, enhancement of digital images using enhancement algorithms running on X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> (rather than being performed in a dedicated acquisition workstation). Thus, in such embodiments, X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> can provide the necessary enhancement algorithms. Standard image processing can include offset correction, gain correction, and defect correction. Offset correction shifts the baseline level of each pixel so that the pixels share the same baseline output level. Gain correction normalizes the response of each pixel to X-ray input. Together, offset and gain correction allow the collection of pixels that form the image to have a uniform response to X-ray input. In addition, imaging detectors can have at least a few pixels that are defective in some way, and can't be normalized using offset and gain correction. Defect correction replaces such defective pixels using an average of nearest neighbor pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Three types of image enhancement algorithms (beyond standard image processing) that may be employed in various embodiments include: grid detection and suppression; scatter correction; and essential enhancement.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In grid detection and suppression, a one dimensional X-ray grid comprises a group of narrow, parallel strips of dense material, with a narrow gap between each strip. Such a grid can be used to reduce the obscuring effects of X-rays which are scattered by the subject's body or surrounding objects, without being absorbed. The grid detection and suppression algorithm can include various methods. The grid detection method determines if grid is present. The grid characterization and suppression methods are used if grid is present. Grid characterization determines attributes such as the frequency of the grid, the magnitude of the grid peak, the spread of the grid peak, and the orientation of the grid. Grid suppression includes a series of one-dimensional band-stop filters.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Scatter correction is an alternative (or supplemental) technique for reducing the effects of scattered, non-absorbed radiation. The effects of scatter of X-rays by the subject's body or other adjacent materials can be estimated by using a scatter kernel. This scatter kernel can be used to remove the contribution of scatter radiation from the overall signal, leaving only the desired signal due to primary (non-scattered) radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In essential enhancement, an image is first processed for overall contrast and brightness enhancement based on the analysis of the data present in the image and exam based parameters. Then, the image is split in different frequencies that are enhanced adaptively based on analysis of input data as well as provided parameters. In so doing, the contrast, sharpness and noise level of organs, tissues and bone boundaries in the image is controlled. Essential enhancement algorithms make an image clinically useful when only basic image processing is applied to an X-ray image.</p>

Thus, metadata indicating up/down/left/right for a particular image can be collected at the time of image acquisition. In some embodiments, accelerometer <b>260</b> can also indicate when X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> has been bumped, thereby preventing signals generated by X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b> during such a bump from being interpreted as an image signal generated in response to incident X-rays.

Battery/supercapacitor <b>267</b> serves as a power source for X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, batter/supercapacitor <b>267</b> is also configured as a temporary uninterrupted power supply or other power source for X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> to facilitate battery hot-swapping. Status indicators <b>269</b> include visual indicators, such as one or more color-coded light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and/or audible indicators, such as one or more buzzers. Status indicators <b>269</b> can provide information to a user associated with one or more of current power state, battery state, wireless communication state, system state, completion of a current image acquisition, and the like.

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Power button <b>268</b> enables various user inputs to control the power state of CPU <b>220</b>, sensor panel processor <b>250</b>, and/or X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> as a whole. For example, in some embodiments, when X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> is off, pressing power button <b>268</b> for more than a certain time interval, such as one second, results in sensor panel processor <b>250</b> turning on and booting up. In some embodiments, when X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> is operating, pressing power button <b>268</b> for a longer time interval, for example between one and three seconds, results in CPU <b>220</b>, sensor panel processor <b>250</b>, and/or X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> as a whole to exit any lower power state, such as an idle or sleep state, and enter a normal operating power state. In some embodiments, when X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> is operating, pressing power button <b>268</b> for a still longer time interval, for example between three and six seconds, results in CPU <b>220</b> and sensor panel processor <b>250</b> attempting to shut down. In some embodiments, when X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> is operating, pressing power button <b>268</b> for an even longer time interval, for example greater than six seconds, results in CPU <b>220</b> and sensor panel processor <b>250</b> immediately shutting down. In other embodiments, any other technically feasible user input scheme may be employed in conjunction with power button <b>268</b> to cause sensor panel processor <b>250</b> and/or CPU <b>220</b> to enter a certain power state.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> is configured with a power state architecture that includes a first power region <b>291</b> that performs image acquisition and a second power region <b>292</b> that performs UI and image processing functions. As shown, sensor panel processor <b>250</b> and X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b> are included in first power region <b>291</b> and CPU <b>220</b> and associated devices are included second power region <b>292</b>. To save power, the processor associated with the first power region, i.e., sensor panel processor <b>250</b>, and the processor associated with the second power region, i.e., CPU <b>220</b>, can each independently enter an idle or other lower-power consumption state, such as a sleep state. Thus, sensor panel processor <b>250</b> and first power region <b>291</b> operate according to one power state scheme, described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, while CPU <b>220</b> and second power region <b>292</b> operate according to another power state scheme, described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a power state diagram <b>300</b> for sensor panel processor <b>250</b> and first power region <b>291</b>, according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown, sensor panel processor <b>250</b> operates in four different power states: an off state <b>301</b>, an idle state <b>302</b>, a ready state <b>303</b>, and a busy state <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In idle state <b>302</b>, X-ray sensor analog devices <b>270</b>, i.e., the light sensors of X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b>, are powered, but in a resting state, i.e., low voltages are applied to X-ray sensor analog devices <b>270</b>. In addition, in some embodiments, in idle state <b>302</b> X-ray sensor analog devices <b>270</b> do not respond to positive gate voltages (typically generated by incident X-rays) greater than a predetermined threshold value, for example one volt. Little power is required for idle state <b>302</b> and, as a result, X-ray sensor panel can remain in idle state <b>302</b> with relatively low power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In ready state <b>303</b>, X-ray sensor analog devices <b>270</b> are powered and ready to detect X-ray exposure. Thus, incident X-rays can generate voltages higher than the predetermined threshold value of idle state <b>302</b>. Because X-ray sensor analog devices <b>270</b> are in a low power state, but can detect incident X-rays, ready state <b>303</b> can be considered a &#x201c;vTrigger&#x201d; state. In this power state, once incident X-rays are detected, image acquisition can be triggered by causing X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b> to enter busy state <b>304</b>. In an embodiment, the trigger can be from a user access device (&#x201c;Wireless Device&#x201d;) or a &#x201c;vTrigger.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In busy state <b>304</b>, X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b> performs image acquisition, i.e., waiting for an integration time, reading out X-ray sensor analog devices <b>270</b>, and in some embodiments, waiting for another integration time for a post-offset image and reading out X-ray sensor analog devices <b>270</b> a second time.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown, sensor panel processor <b>250</b> and X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b> enter idle state <b>302</b> from off state <b>301</b> in response to a power on indicator, for example, when a user depresses power button <b>268</b> for more than one second. Sensor panel processor <b>250</b> and X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b> enter idle state <b>302</b> from ready state <b>303</b> in response to a software command. Such a software command may be generated in response to a user input from user access device <b>110</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), to X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b> remaining idle for more than a maximum threshold time, etc. Similarly, sensor panel processor <b>250</b> and X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b> enter ready state <b>303</b> from idle state <b>302</b> in response to such a software command. In addition, sensor panel processor <b>250</b> and X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b> enter ready state <b>303</b> from busy state <b>304</b> in response to completion of the acquisition of an image. Sensor panel processor <b>250</b> and X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b> enter busy state <b>304</b> from ready state <b>303</b> in response to a vTrigger, i.e. when X-ray sensor analog devices <b>270</b> detect incident X-rays when X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b> is in ready state <b>303</b>. Alternatively or additionally, sensor panel processor <b>250</b> and X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b> enter busy state <b>304</b> from ready state <b>303</b> in response to a wireless trigger, such as a transmission from user access device <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, when sensor panel processor <b>250</b> and X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b> enter idle state <b>302</b> from off state <b>301</b>, sensor panel processor <b>250</b> powers up CPU <b>220</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Thus, in such embodiments, sensor panel processor <b>250</b> controls the initial power state of CPU <b>220</b>. In addition, in some embodiments, when sensor panel processor <b>250</b> and X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b> are in ready state <b>303</b> and X-rays are detected, sensor panel processor <b>250</b> causes CPU <b>220</b> to exit a sleep or idle state if CPU <b>220</b> is in such a state. For example, sensor panel processor <b>250</b> can transmit a &#x201c;wake on WLAN&#x201d; command (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). In such embodiments, CPU <b>220</b> and second power region <b>292</b> are thereby made ready to process and display images for a user with reduced or minimal delay, but can remain in a lower power consumption state when no images are being acquired by sensor panel processor <b>250</b> and X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a power state diagram <b>400</b> for CPU <b>220</b> and second power region <b>292</b>, according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown, CPU <b>220</b> operates in four different power states: an off state <b>401</b>, a sleep state <b>402</b>, a low awake state <b>403</b>, and a high active state <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In idle state <b>402</b>, no software is operating in CPU <b>220</b>. In some embodiments, idle state <b>402</b> is substantially similar to an S3 sleep state. In such embodiments, CPU <b>220</b> operates according to a typical S3 power state, including entering off state <b>401</b> when a critical battery power is detected, and entering high active state <b>404</b> when power button <b>268</b> is depressed for a particular duration of time (e.g., one to three seconds). Similarly, CPU <b>220</b> enters idle state <b>402</b> from low awake state <b>403</b> in response to a battery removal event, low battery detection, or no activity for more than a maximum time threshold. In addition, in some embodiments, in idle state <b>402</b> CPU <b>220</b> is configured to enter low awake state <b>403</b> when a battery insertion is detected, or when CPU <b>220</b> receives a &#x201c;wake on WLAN,&#x201d; for example in response to detection of X-rays, and/or when CPU <b>220</b> receives a shake input from sensor panel processor <b>250</b>. In some embodiments, a PCI Express (PCIe) wake mechanism is employed to cause CPU <b>220</b> to enter low awake state <b>403</b> from idle state <b>402</b>. In some embodiments, wireless module <b>233</b> or <b>234</b> is programmed to assert a PCIe Wake signal when a particular type of packet is detected from sensor panel processor <b>250</b>. It is noted that CPU <b>220</b> can be in idle state <b>402</b> while sensor panel processor <b>250</b> is in ready state <b>303</b> or busy state <b>304</b>, thereby avoiding unnecessary energy consumption by X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In low awake state <b>403</b>, CPU <b>220</b> operates in a lower power consumption state (i.e., a lower activity level operating state), such as an S0 low awake state. Low awake state <b>403</b> is a lower power consumption state than a normal operating state, such as high active state <b>404</b>. Thus, one or more cores of CPU <b>220</b> are parked if not executing software. CPU <b>220</b> enters low awake state <b>403</b> from high active state <b>404</b> in response to low battery detection, low activity detection, or a battery removal event.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In high active state <b>404</b>, CPU <b>220</b> operates a standard operating state, such as an S0 high active state. Thus, CPU <b>220</b> enters high active state <b>404</b> from off state <b>401</b> in response to power button <b>268</b> being depressed, from sleep state <b>402</b> in response to power button <b>268</b> being depressed, and from low awake state <b>403</b> in response to detecting a high activity level. In addition, CPU <b>220</b> enters off state <b>401</b> from high active state <b>404</b> in response to power button <b>268</b> being depressed for an extended duration, such as greater than six seconds, or in response to a software command, for example via a user input to user access device <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As illustrated by power state diagram <b>400</b>, CPU <b>220</b> and second power region <b>292</b> are configured to enter a lower power consumption state independently from sensor panel processor <b>250</b> (or functionality) and first power region <b>291</b>. For example, during a period of time in which a large number of images are acquired but no image processing or communication with remote servers <b>140</b> is required, CPU <b>220</b> and second power region <b>292</b> can remain in low awake state <b>403</b> or sleep state <b>402</b> while sensor panel processor <b>250</b> and X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b> operate in ready state <b>303</b> and/or busy state <b>304</b>, thereby greatly reducing power consumption of X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b>. Thus, by operating CPU <b>220</b> and second power region <b>292</b> in a lower power consumption state until image processing is needed for an acquired image, a significant reduction in power consumption of X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> can be realized. It is noted that for a typical processor, power consumption in high active state <b>404</b> may be on the order of about 20 W, power consumption in low awake state <b>403</b> may be on the order of about 5 W, and power consumption in sleep state <b>402</b> may be on the order of about 0.5 W.</p>

Although the method is described in conjunction with digital radiographic X-ray acquisition system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, persons skilled in the art will understand that any suitably configured radiographic system is within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Prior to the method step, sensor panel processor <b>250</b> and first power region <b>291</b> enter ready state <b>303</b>, for example in response to a user starting up X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> via power button <b>268</b>. In addition, CPU <b>220</b> and second power region <b>292</b> enter sleep state <b>402</b>, for example in response to the detection of low activity in CPU <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A method <b>500</b> begins at step <b>501</b>, in which sensor panel processor <b>250</b> detects X-rays incident on X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b> via a plurality of signals from X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b>. For example, in some embodiments, X-ray sensor analog devices <b>270</b> each transmit a voltage signal to sensor panel processor <b>250</b> in response to incident light generated by a scintillator material disposed on X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b>, where the scintillator material emits visible light when excited by incident X-rays.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In step <b>502</b>, sensor panel processor <b>250</b> determines whether the plurality of signals are associated with a bumping or jarring of X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b>, based on outputs from accelerometer <b>260</b> and/or shock sensor <b>265</b>. If yes, method <b>500</b> proceeds to step <b>510</b> and ends; if no, method <b>500</b> proceeds to step <b>503</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In step <b>503</b>, sensor panel processor <b>250</b> (or sensor panel processor functionality) causes CPU <b>220</b> (or CPU functionality) to enter a higher power consumption state, such as high active state <b>404</b> or low awake state <b>403</b>. For example, in some embodiments, sensor panel processor <b>250</b> transmits a wake on WLAN packet to CPU <b>220</b> via wireless module <b>233</b> or <b>234</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In step <b>504</b>, sensor panel processor <b>250</b> generates a digital representation of an X-ray image based on the plurality of signals received in step <b>501</b>. For example, the digital representation may include an intensity value for each pixel of X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b>, as well as suitable metadata associated with the intensity values.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In step <b>505</b>, sensor panel processor <b>250</b> transmits the digital representation of the X-ray image to CPU <b>220</b> for subsequent image processing. It is noted that CPU <b>220</b> is in an active state, such as high active state <b>404</b> or low awake state <b>403</b> during step <b>505</b>, and therefore is ready to immediately begin the process of generating an image from the digital representation transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In step <b>506</b>, CPU <b>220</b> generates a digital image based on the digital representation transmitted in step <b>505</b>, such as a digital image file in a standard image format (e.g., bmp, gif, jpg, tif, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In X-ray radiography, alternating current (AC) noise can affect the quality of digital images generated by X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> when an AC noise source is proximate X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b>. For example, switching of the millions of transistors in CPU <b>220</b> in the GHz regime can be one such noise source. According to some embodiments, the switching of some or all components in X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> is synchronized during operation. As a result, the impact of switching noise in images generated by X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> can be made static from image to image. Consequently, the subtraction of an offset image from an acquired image will also remove such static noise. It is noted that the technique of subtracting an offset image (i.e., an image taken immediately after an exposed image but containing no dose) from an acquired image is generally used to compensate for temperature-induced and other short-term drift of the ASICs in X-ray sensor panel <b>280</b> used to read charge.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">According to some embodiments, all the switching in X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> is synchronized. Because various devices in X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> that act as noise sources may asynchronously enter or exit a sleep mode during normal operation, in some embodiments a synchronization clock is modified to compensate for such asynchronous sleeping and waking of devices. According to such embodiments, CPU <b>220</b> and other noise source devices are synchronized to a single clock. Because processors suitable for use as CPU <b>220</b> typically are not designed to be synchronized to a single external clock, X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> is synchronized to CPU <b>220</b> and not vice-versa.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> sets forth a flowchart summarizing an example method for acquiring an X-ray image, according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure. The method may include one or more operations, functions, or actions as illustrated by one or more of blocks <b>601</b>-<b>605</b>. Although the blocks are illustrated in a sequential order, these blocks may be performed in parallel, and/or in a different order than those described herein. Also, the various blocks may be combined into fewer blocks, divided into additional blocks, and/or eliminated based upon the desired implementation. Although the method is described in conjunction with digital radiographic X-ray acquisition system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, persons skilled in the art will understand that any suitably configured radiographic system is within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Prior to the method step, a patient study is scheduled for a particular clinical location and stored in remote servers <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A method <b>600</b> begins at step <b>601</b>, in which X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> queries one or more remote servers <b>140</b> for one or more studies to be performed for a particular patient. In some embodiments, a user initiates the query via user access device <b>110</b> and X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> the communicates with one or more remote servers <b>140</b> via wireless access point <b>130</b> or network <b>105</b>. For example, X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> may query a DICOM&#xae; Modality Worklist Server.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In step <b>602</b>, X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> receives one or more studies to be performed on the particular patient from remote servers <b>140</b>, such as a DICOM&#xae; Modality Worklist Server.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In step <b>603</b>, X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> receives commands from user access device <b>110</b> to acquire one or more X-ray images.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In step <b>604</b>, X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> acquires and locally stores the one or more X-ray images. For example, in some embodiments, the acquired X-ray images and/or digital representations of the acquired X-ray images are stored in SSD <b>232</b>. Consequently, a user can subsequently access such X-ray images or digital representations thereof via user access device <b>110</b> and without accessing a remote server <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In step <b>605</b>, X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> transmits the one or more X-ray images to one of remote servers <b>140</b>. It is noted that such direct upload of image data provides for real-time availability of studies for review on a hospital PACS, without having to connect X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> to a dedicated workstation. Similarly, direct download of worklist data provides for real-time updates to worklists (i.e., studies to be acquired), without having to connect X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> to a dedicated workstation. It is further noted that in a conventional digital radiographic X-ray acquisition system, the above steps are generally coordinated and performed by software running on a separate computer workstation. According to various embodiments, using X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b>, such software actually runs on X-ray imaging detector <b>120</b> itself. Thus, the user accesses the panel software via a &#x201c;dumb&#x201d; device (e.g., user access device <b>110</b>). That is, the device can provide user access to panel software with the inclusion of an HTML5-compliant browser, and little or no other installed proprietary software.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The functionality of a conventional radiographic X-ray acquisition system can be provided without an external data acquisition and processing workstation. Thus, a digital X-ray image is generated via a portable, battery-powered, X-ray sensor system, and made available to a user via the user's computing device. The X-ray system is configured with a first power region that performs image acquisition and a second power region that performs user interface, networking, and image processing functions. To save power, the processor associated with the first power region and the processor associated with the second power region can each independently enter a lower power consumption state, such as an idle state or a sleep state.</p>
