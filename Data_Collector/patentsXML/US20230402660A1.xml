<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The described technology relates to a battery apparatus, a battery management system, and a precharge method.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An electric vehicle is a vehicle that obtains power by driving a motor mainly using a battery as a power supply. The electric vehicles are being actively researched because they are alternatives that can solve pollution and energy problems of internal combustion vehicles. Rechargeable batteries are used in various external apparatuses other than the electric vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, as a battery having a high output and a large capacity is required, a battery apparatus in which a plurality of battery packs are connected in parallel is used. A switching circuit for a connection control of the battery pack may be used for each battery pack. A precharge circuit is used for each switching circuit in order to prevent a rush current generated at the beginning of driving by the switching circuit. The precharge circuit can prevent the inrush current by precharging a capacitor connected to an inverter of an external device through a precharge resistor at the beginning of driving. An overcurrent that may occur at the beginning of driving frequently flows through the precharge resistor. When the overcurrent frequently flows through the precharge resistor, a cycle-life of the precharge circuit may be reduced.</p>

When the precharge switch <b>123</b> and the negative switch <b>122</b> are closed, a current is supplied from the battery pack <b>110</b> to a capacitor <b>11</b> of the external apparatus <b>10</b> through the precharge resistor <b>124</b> to precharge the capacitor <b>11</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the precharge circuit including the precharge switch <b>123</b> and the precharge resistor <b>124</b> connected in series, other precharge circuits capable of precharging the capacitor <b>11</b> in response to the control signals from the precharge control circuit <b>130</b> may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The precharge control circuits <b>130</b> correspond to the switching circuits <b>120</b>, respectively. That is, each of the precharge control circuits <b>130</b> is connected to a corresponding switching circuit <b>120</b> among the switching circuits <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the precharge control circuit <b>130</b> may control an operation of the corresponding precharge switch <b>123</b> based on a difference between a voltage of a corresponding battery pack <b>110</b> and a voltage of the capacitor <b>11</b>. The precharge control circuit <b>130</b> operates in response to the control signals Cpc<b>1</b> and Cpc<b>2</b> for closing the precharge switch <b>123</b> of the corresponding switching circuit <b>120</b> from the processor <b>140</b>. Upon receiving the control signals Cpc<b>1</b> and Cpc<b>2</b> for closing the precharge switch <b>123</b>, the precharge control circuit <b>130</b> may close the precharge switch <b>123</b> when the voltage of the capacitor <b>11</b> is lower than the voltage of the corresponding battery pack <b>110</b>, and may not close the precharge switch <b>123</b> when the voltage of the capacitor <b>11</b> is equal to or similar to the voltage of the corresponding battery pack <b>110</b>. For example, when the difference between the voltage of the battery pack <b>110</b> and the voltage of the capacitor <b>11</b> is less than or equal to a predetermined voltage (first predetermined voltage), it may be determined that the voltage of the capacitor <b>11</b> is equal to or similar to the voltage of the battery pack <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the predetermined voltage may be 0V.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The processor <b>140</b> controls operations of the switching circuits <b>120</b> and the precharge control circuits <b>130</b>. The processor <b>140</b> may include, for example, a micro controller unit (MCU). In some embodiments, the processor <b>140</b> may select a battery pack <b>110</b> to first supply power based on voltages of the battery packs <b>110</b>. Accordingly, the processor <b>140</b> may drive the switching circuit <b>120</b> corresponding to the selected battery pack <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, the processor <b>140</b> may supply the power through the battery pack <b>110</b> by controlling the switching circuit <b>120</b> connected to the battery pack <b>110</b> having the highest voltage among the battery packs <b>110</b>. Next, when the voltage of the corresponding battery pack <b>110</b> becomes similar to the voltages of the other battery packs <b>110</b>, the processor <b>140</b> may control the switching circuit <b>120</b> connected to the other battery packs <b>110</b> to supply the power through at least two battery packs <b>110</b> that are connected in parallel. Upon supplying the power simultaneously through two battery packs <b>110</b>, if a voltage difference between the two battery packs <b>110</b> is greater than a predetermined voltage (second predetermined voltage), an inrush current may flow from the battery pack <b>110</b> with a high voltage to the battery pack <b>110</b> with a low voltage. Accordingly, the generation of the inrush current can be prevented by first supplying the power through the battery pack <b>110</b> having the high voltage, and then supplying the power through the other battery pack <b>110</b> when the voltages of the two battery packs become similar. In some embodiments, a case where the voltages of the two battery packs <b>110</b> become similar may mean a case where a voltage difference between the two battery packs <b>110</b> becomes less than or equal to a predetermined voltage.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, when a battery apparatus is initially driven, a processor <b>140</b> first supplies power through a battery pack (e.g., BP<b>1</b>) having a high voltage among a plurality of battery packs BP<b>1</b> and BP<b>2</b>. To this end, the processor <b>140</b> first outputs a control signal Cn<b>1</b> for closing a negative switch <b>122</b> of a switching circuit connected to the battery pack BP<b>1</b>. That is, the processor <b>140</b> switches the control signal Cn<b>1</b> from a disable level to an enable level. In some embodiments, the enable level may be a high level H and the disable level may be a low level L.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Next, the processor <b>140</b> outputs a control signal Cpc<b>1</b> for closing a precharge switch (e.g., <b>123</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) connected to the battery pack BP<b>1</b> while the negative switch <b>122</b> is closed. That is, the processor <b>140</b> switches the control signal Cpc<b>1</b> from the disable level to the enable level. The precharge control circuit <b>130</b> outputs a control signal Cpc<b>1</b>′ having the enable level in response to the control signal Cpc<b>1</b>. When the precharge switch <b>123</b> is closed in response to the control signal Cpc<b>1</b>′, a precharge current is supplied from the battery pack BP<b>1</b> to a capacitor <b>11</b> of an external apparatus through a precharge resistor <b>124</b> so that the capacitor <b>11</b> can be precharged. On the other hand, when the capacitor <b>11</b> has been already charged to a voltage of battery pack BP<b>1</b>, the precharge control circuit <b>130</b> outputs the control signal Cpc<b>1</b>′ having the disable level regardless of the enable level of the control signal Cpc<b>1</b> so that the precharge switch <b>123</b> may be not closed. Further, when the precharge switch <b>123</b> is closed and then the capacitor <b>11</b> is precharged to the voltage of the battery pack BP<b>1</b>, even before the control signal Cpc<b>1</b> changes to the disable level, the precharge control circuit <b>130</b> switches the control signal Cpc<b>1</b>′ to the disable level so that the precharge switch <b>123</b> may be opened.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">After precharging the capacitor <b>11</b>, the processor <b>140</b> outputs the control signal Cp<b>1</b> for closing a positive switch <b>121</b> connected to the battery pack BP<b>1</b> to supply power through the battery pack BP<b>1</b>.

The electric vehicles are being actively researched because they are alternatives that can solve pollution and energy problems of internal combustion vehicles. Rechargeable batteries are used in various external apparatuses other than the electric vehicles.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>

A switching circuit for a connection control of the battery pack may be used for each battery pack. A precharge circuit is used for each switching circuit in order to prevent a rush current generated at the beginning of driving by the switching circuit. The precharge circuit can prevent the inrush current by precharging a capacitor connected to an inverter of an external device through a precharge resistor at the beginning of driving. An overcurrent that may occur at the beginning of driving frequently flows through the precharge resistor. When the overcurrent frequently flows through the precharge resistor, a cycle-life of the precharge circuit may be reduced.</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><span>
